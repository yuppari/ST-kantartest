Consciousness returned like a slow, painful tide. The air was thick with the smell of rust and damp concrete. Cold metal dug into his wrists and ankles, securing him to a chair. He tested the restraints; they were tight, unforgiving.\n\nA single, bare bulb swung lazily overhead, casting long, dancing shadows across the room. In the flickering light, he saw another figure slumped in a chair opposite him. Nuka. His head was bowed, but Gelbstein could see the slow rise and fall of his chest. He was alive. For now.\n\nThe heavy clank of a steel door being unbarred echoed in the small space. Footsteps approached—confident, familiar. A figure emerged from the oppressive darkness, stopping right in the middle of the room. Peterson. The fucking traitor stood there, no longer in a Falkos uniform, looking down at them as if they were insects.\n\"Captain. Private,\" Peterson said, his voice devoid of any warmth it once held. \"Glad you could join us.\"\n\n\"Peterson,\" Gelbstein growled, the name tasting like bile in his mouth. \"When I get out of this chair, I am going to rip your fucking spine out.\" He pulled against the locks, the metal scraping against his skin. This was useless.\n\nPeterson let out a short, humorless laugh. He gestured to a pair of silent Bhiya operatives flanking him. \"There will be none of that. I need information. Falkos mission coordinates for the last quarter. Everything.\" He stared at Gelbstein, his gaze cold. \"You cooperate, maybe I let the little one live.\"\n\nHe saw Nuka stir, lifting his head. There was a fresh gash on his cheek, but his eyes were defiant. \"Go fuck your mother,\" Nuka spat, his voice hoarse.\n\nPeterson's expression didn't change. He simply nodded to one of the goons. The man moved toward Nuka, pulling a pair of pliers from his belt. Gelbstein's blood ran cold.\n\"No. You deal with me, you piece of shit,\" Gelbstein yelled, trying to draw their attention. \"Leave him out of it!\"\n\nThe operative grabbed Nuka’s left hand, forcing it flat against the armrest of the chair. Nuka struggled, but he was bound too tightly.\n\"The coordinates, Captain,\" Peterson repeated calmly, as if discussing the weather. \"Give them to me, and this stops.\"\n\n\"Fuck you,\" Gelbstein bit out, his eyes locked on the glint of the pliers. He watched, helpless, as the tool was positioned over Nuka's index finger.\nA sickening *crunch* of bone and flesh followed, tearing a strangled scream from Nuka’s throat. It was a raw, agonizing sound that cut straight through Gelbstein. He thrashed in his chair, a guttural roar of fury escaping him. \"I'M GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU!\"\n\nPeterson ignored him, his focus unwavering. \"The next finger, Captain. Or we could try a kneecap. I'm not a picky man.\"\nNuka was panting, sweat and tears mingling with the blood on his face, but he managed to look at Gelbstein. He shook his head, a tiny, desperate motion. *Don't.*\n\nThe silence stretched, broken only by Nuka's ragged breaths. Peterson finally sighed, a sound of genuine disappointment. \"You Falkos men. So predictably stubborn.\" He pulled his sidearm from its holster. \"You're both compromised. You're no use to me alive if you won't talk.\" He walked over, not to Nuka, but to Gelbstein. He pressed the cold muzzle of the pistol against Gelbstein's chest, right over his heart.\n\"This is your last chance, Captain.\"\n\nGelbstein just stared into his eyes, filled with a hate so pure it was almost serene. \"Suck my dick.\"\n*BANG.*\nThe world exploded in a flash of white-hot pain. A force like a sledgehammer slammed into his chest, stealing his breath. Gelbstein’s head snapped back, his body slumping forward against the restraints. His vision swam, the edges turning dark. Through the ringing in his ears, he heard Nuka screaming his name, a sound of pure terror and desperation.\n\nHis gaze found Nuka one last time. The man's face was a mask of horror. As Gelbstein’s life bled out onto the concrete floor, he saw Nuka’s foot slam back against the leg of his own chair. A sharp, distinct *tap*.\nWhat the fuck was he doing—\nDarkness swallowed everything.","A dull ache hammered against the inside of his skull. Consciousness returned like a slow, painful tide, dragging him from a black, dreamless void. His wrists and ankles were raw, chafed against what felt like heavy metal locks securing him to a chair. A cold bastard of a chair. A single, bare lightbulb swung from a cord overhead, casting long, dancing shadows across the damp concrete floor. The only sounds were the rhythmic *creak* of the chain and the drip, drip, drip of water somewhere in the darkness.\n\nHe blinked the grit from his eyes, his gaze immediately snapping to the other figure in the room. Nuka. Slumped in a chair identical to his own, head lolling forward. Still breathing, thank fuck for small mercies. The kid looked roughed up, a fresh cut bleeding sluggishly on his cheek, but he was alive. For now. Gelbstein tested his bonds, pulling hard. The metal didn't give, it only bit deeper into his flesh. Fucking solid.\n\nA heavy metal door scraped open, flooding the room with brighter light for a moment before slamming shut with a deafening *THUD*. A silhouette stood there, resolving into a familiar, treacherous face as it stepped into the dim light. Peterson. Fucking Worm. The piece of shit had the gall to smile, a lazy, confident expression that made Gelbstein want to rip his throat out with his teeth. He wasn’t alone; two larger men flanked him, their faces impassive and cruel.\n\n“Captain. Private. Glad you could finally join us.” Peterson's voice was calm, conversational. It made Gelbstein's blood run cold with a quiet, simmering rage. He pulled up a spare metal stool, the legs scraping loudly against the concrete, and sat down backwards, arms resting on its backrest. \"Now, this can be quick and relatively painless, or it can be a very, very long night. The choice is yours.\"\n\nHe saw Nuka stir, lifting his head. A glare of pure, undiluted hatred was aimed at the traitor. \"Eat shit,\" Nuka spat, his voice hoarse but firm.\n\nPeterson simply chuckled, a dry and humorless sound. “Spirit. I always admired that. But it won't do you any good here.” He leaned forward slightly. “I’ll make this simple. Falkos mission logs. Specifically, the Kantar and West Platinn coordinates for the next two months. Give them to me.”\n\nGelbstein stared him down, letting the silence stretch. He gave nothing away, his face a mask of stone. Every instinct screamed at him, every fiber of his being was coiled tight, ready for a violence he couldn't unleash. “Go fuck yourself, Peterson,” the words were a low growl, thick with his Saneran accent.\n\nPeterson sighed, a theatrical display of disappointment. “I was afraid you’d say that. I really was.” He nodded to the two brutes standing by the door. “Start with the little one. Let’s see how much the Captain enjoys the show.” One of the men moved with brutal efficiency, grabbing Nuka by the hair and yanking his head back. The other drew back a fist. The sound of knuckles hitting flesh was a wet, ugly *SMACK*.\n\nNuka cried out, a sharp, strangled noise that cut right through Gelbstein’s composure. Instinct took over. He strained against the locks, muscles screaming in protest, the metal digging into his skin until it bled. Fucking useless. He could only watch as another blow landed, this time to the gut. Nuka gasped, doubling over as much as the restraints would allow.\n\n“Give me the coordinates, Captain,” Peterson’s voice was dangerously soft, cutting through the haze of fury. “Or we start breaking things. Fingers, maybe? Let's dislocate his shoulder first, shall we? I’m open to suggestions.” He gestured, and one of the men grabbed Nuka’s arm, forcing it back at an unnatural angle. A gut-wrenching scream tore from Nuka's throat as a sickening *POP* echoed in the small room.\n\nGelbstein’s own breath hitched. He shut his eyes for a second, the sound burning itself into his brain. He opened them again, his gaze locking with Peterson’s, promising a violent, painful death. “You will get… nothing.”","A groan rumbled deep in his chest as consciousness clawed its way back. The world swam into focus with a nauseating sway, timed to the creak of a single, naked bulb swinging overhead. The light cast long, dancing shadows across a damp concrete floor. His head throbbed, a dull, hammering pain behind the eyes. A metallic taste, coppery and foul, coated his tongue. Blood. His blood. He was seated, he realized. Secured to a cold, hard chair. Metal cuffs dug into his wrists and ankles, tight enough to cut off circulation. Fucking perfect.\n\nHe tested the restraints, pulling against them with the full force of his shoulders. The chair didn't budge, bolted to the floor. The metal only bit deeper into his flesh. Shit. He scanned the room, his eyes adjusting to the gloom. And then he saw him. Nuka. Slumped in a chair identical to his own, just a few meters away. The younger man was still out, his head lolled to one side. Fuck. This was bad. This was very, very bad. His own fuck-up. He was the Captain, he was responsible. Now his man was in enemy hands because of him. The thought was a hot spike of acid in his gut.\n\nFootsteps echoed from a dark hallway, growing louder. Two men emerged into the light. One was a tall, nondescript brute. The other, the one who looked to be in charge, had a face that was just begging to be rearranged by a good punch. This must be Peterson. \"Well, look what we have here. The big Captain Gelbstein of Falkos's esteemed Alpha Team. And a little birdy.\" His voice was calm, almost conversational, which made it all the more infuriating. \"I have questions. You have answers. Provide them, and this ordeal can be over with minimal fuss.\"\n\nGino spat a clot of blood and saliva onto the floor. \"Go fuck yourself.\"\n\nPeterson’s smile didn’t waver. It was a cold, dead thing. \"That's one way to go about it.\" He gestured to the brute, who immediately moved towards Nuka. \"But I find it's always better to start with the subordinate. They're usually so eager to stop the pain.\" The brute grabbed a fistful of Nuka's hair, yanking his head back with a sickening snap. Nuka came to with a choked gasp, eyes flying wide with panic and pain.\n\nA primal roar of fury tore from Gino's throat. He surged against his bonds, the steel grinding against his bones. The chair creaked under the strain but held fast. \"Don't you fucking touch him, you hear me?! You want something, you deal with me, you cowardly piece of shit!\"\n\nPeterson completely ignored him, his focus entirely on Nuka. \"The coordinates for your last three missions. And the next one. Simple.\" The brute produced a pair of pliers, the metal glinting under the dim light. He grabbed Nuka's left hand, pinning it to the armrest of the chair. Nuka struggled, his breath coming in ragged, terrified pants. A high-pitched, desperate whine tore from his throat.\n\n\"I will kill you,\" Gino seethed, his voice dropping to a low, guttural promise. \"I will fucking find you and I will tear your throat out with my teeth.\"\n\n*CRACK.*\n\nThe sound was sharp, sickeningly loud in the small room. It was followed by a raw, agonized scream from Nuka that clawed at Gino's insides. The brute had broken one of his fingers. He was holding up the pliers again, ready for the next one. Nuka was sobbing now, a mess of tears and snot, but no words came out. Not a single coordinate. Not a single piece of intel. Just pure, unadulterated pain.\n\n\"Fucking stop it!\" Gino bellowed, his voice hoarse with rage. He thrashed violently, putting every ounce of his strength into breaking free, into getting to them. \"He doesn't know anything! He's just a private, you fucking cunts! You want intel, you come to me!\" It was a lie, Nuka knew plenty, but it was all he had. Peterson watched Gino's futile struggle with detached amusement before nodding to the brute. Another finger. *SNAP.* Another scream tore through the air, this one weaker, choked with agony."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 6, 2025 12:55am","gen_started":"2025-06-05T16:54:48.839Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-05T16:55:08.917Z","extra":{"api":"openrouter","model":"google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview","reasoning":"**Assessing the Situation**\n\nI'm currently dissecting the user's prompt, mapping out the essential components.

I'm considering the brutal interrogation tactics, focusing on creating a realistic portrayal of torture and the emotional impact on both Gelbstein and Nuka. I'm also thinking about the activation of the time loop device, planning how each character can trigger it after being fatally wounded.\n\n\n**Planning the Execution**\n\nI've mapped out the loop activation conditions meticulously. The boots, the wounds, the blood registry—it's all coming together to create a tight, suspenseful trigger. I'm now strategizing how to interweave the torture with the device, ensuring each death scene feels impactful and fresh, even in a loop.\n\n\n**Defining the Conflict**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the initial confrontation. Peterson's entrance is key, the betrayal must be felt viscerally through Gelbstein's internal thoughts. I'm planning on a calculated escalation from psychological pressure to physical violence.

I'm focusing on the specific injuries Nuka will sustain and how Gelbstein reacts internally to each blow. The goal is to build the despair and tension leading to the loop trigger.

I'm about ready to put words to the opening action.\n\n\n**Forming the Opening Scene**\n\nI'm now creating the very first moments of the story. Gelbstein's senses will be key to pulling the user in. I'm working on the sensory details—the cold metal, the swinging light, the throbbing pain, and the distinct scent of the room. I've started with the opening line, aiming for a sense of disorientation, then moving quickly to the presence of Nuka and a general view of the bleak surroundings.\n\n\n**Beginning the First Draft**\n\nI'm now launching into the narrative with the opening lines. I'm prioritizing the sensory experience, immediately plunging the user into the disorientation of Gelbstein's awakening.

The taunt, layered with Nuka’s bizarre, private jargon, hit a nerve deeper than any accusation of treason. He backhanded Nuka across the face with brutal, unforgiving force. *CRACK.* The sound was sharp, wet.

You give me a stupid fucking answer, he gets a drink.\" He nodded slightly. \"Let's start simple. Where is Gamma team's rally point for Operation Nightshade?\"\n\nThe thug tilted the canteen. Water, cold and dirty, soaked the rag, pouring over Nuka's face. Immediately, his muffled struggles turned frantic. His chest heaved, his body convulsing as his lungs screamed for air that wasn't there. It was a silent, horrific dance of suffocation.

After ten seconds that stretched into an eternity, he gave a curt signal. The thug pulled the rag away. Nuka exploded in a desperate, retching cough, spitting up water and bile. He gasped for air in huge, shuddering gulps, his body trembling, his eyes wide with pure animal terror.\n\n\"Wrong answer,\" Peterson said coolly, as if they were discussing the weather. He let Nuka catch a few precious breaths before nodding at the thug again. The wet rag was slapped back over his face. \"Let's try again. Operation Nightshade. Rally point coordinates.

It was the sound of a man who had broken past pain and was now floating in some wild, delirious stratosphere. It was the sound of someone who had accepted death.\n\nPeterson's face went rigid. The taunt, layered with Nuka’s bizarre, private jargon, hit a nerve deeper than any accusation of treason. He backhanded Nuka across the face with brutal, unforgiving force. *CRACK.* The sound was sharp, wet. Nuka's head whipped to the side, the manic laughter cutting off into a choked, bloody cough.\n\n\"You think this is a fucking game?\" Peterson snarled, grabbing Nuka's jaw and forcing his head straight. \"You think you're clever?\" He shoved Nuka's head back against the chair. He looked at his thugs. \"Water. Now.\"\n\nOne of the masked men produced a dirty rag from a pouch while the other grabbed a metal canteen. Gelbstein’s blood went cold. He knew this technique. It wasn't about pain, not directly. It was about panic. The primal, lizard-brain terror of drowning.\n\n\"Peterson, don't,\" Gelbstein said, his voice dropping low, devoid of the earlier rage, now filled with a chilling deadliness. \"You do this, there's no coming back. For any of us.\"\n\n\"We're long past that point, Captain.\" Peterson gestured. The thug draped the rag over Nuka’s nose and mouth, pressing it down firmly. The other unscrewed the canteen.\n\nNuka, still dazed, began to struggle as he realized what was happening, his body thrashing against the restraints. His one good hand clawed uselessly at the air.\n\n\"This is how it works,\" Peterson explained, his voice conversational as he walked over to stand directly in Gelbstein's line of sight, forcing him to watch. \"I ask a question. You give me a stupid fucking answer, he gets a drink.\" He nodded slightly. \"Let's start simple. Where is Gamma team's rally point for Operation Nightshade?\"\n\nThe thug tilted the canteen. Water, cold and dirty, soaked the rag, pouring over Nuka's face. Immediately, his muffled struggles turned frantic. His chest heaved, his body convulsing as his lungs screamed for air that wasn't there. It was a silent, horrific dance of suffocation. The gurgling, choking sounds were fucking obscene.\n\n\"Stop it, you sick fuck!\" Gelbstein bellowed, throwing his weight against the chair, the legs groaning in protest. \"This isn't an interrogation, you're just a fucking butcher getting his rocks off!\"\n\nPeterson watched Nuka's violent thrashing with a detached interest.

Nuka is taunting Peterson, laughing hysterically and calling them \"spoiled idiots,\" which is designed to provoke a reaction. It is clearly a direct provocation, so I'm observing how the user intends to respond.\n\n\n**Dissecting Provocation's Effects**\n\nI'm now considering the fallout of Nuka's actions. The user's blatant insults are designed to enrage Peterson, and it's working. My primary focus shifts to Gelbstein's reaction. His anger is a volatile mixture of primal protectiveness and tactical assessment, fueled by the betrayal. I'm figuring how Gelbstein can both act in defiance and provide a path forward for the user to escape.\n\n\n**Anticipating Gelbstein's Reactions**\n\nI'm formulating Gelbstein's emotional responses. Peterson's shift from interrogator to sadist is clear. I'll have Gelbstein attempt to bait Peterson into a physical attack, using his own vulnerabilities against him. His focus is split between protecting Nuka, enduring his own pain, and searching for a path out. He needs to assess the situation. The scene is being written around this desperate tension, with the car battery or waterboarding forming the next escalation of the torture.\n\n\n**Crafting Gelbstein's Defense**\n\nI'm refining Gelbstein's response. He needs to both protect Nuka and seek an escape route. I'm currently working on Gelbstein's attempts to provoke Peterson. I'll use his vulnerabilities: his perceived betrayal, his sense of inadequacy, and his need for control. This will be a mix of defiance, desperation, and calculation to get the best reaction out of Peterson.\n\n\n**Structuring the Torture Sequence**\n\nI'm currently outlining the escalation of the scene, working on the new method of torture: waterboarding. Gelbstein will be the emotional core, forced to witness Nuka's ordeal, and his internal reactions will be the focus. I'm structuring the scene to ramp up the tension. The plan is to increase the visceral impact of Peterson's cruelty, while focusing on Gelbstein's internal turmoil.\n\n\n**Constructing Gelbstein's Anguish**\n\nI'm incorporating the waterboarding sequence into the narrative. Gelbstein's perspective is crucial; his helpless anger and despair fuel the scene's emotional core. My focus is on his internal reactions, the graphic torture, and the mounting tension. I'm highlighting Peterson's cruelty and Gelbstein's desperation as he witnesses Nuka's suffering.","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1302}}]}

The interrogation room layout and its immediate impact are now my key focus.\n\n\n**Contemplating Gelbstein's Response**\n\nI'm currently stuck inside Gelbstein's head, and the rage is practically tangible. I'm focusing on the sensory overload – the metallic tang of blood, the rhythmic gurgle of water, the harsh fluorescent lights. My current thought is what could Gelbstein say or do to upset Peterson.

The stakes are high, and time is running out.\n\n\n**Confronting a New Threat**\n\nI'm bracing myself as they begin again, listening to the water's gurgling assault on Nuka.
