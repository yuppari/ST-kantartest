<br> I made a violent scene test using multiple models on SillyTavern.

Competing: Gemini Flash & Pro vs. DS-R1 vs. ArliAI RpR-v1 vs. GPT4.1
<br>Preset used: [Avani Universal 2.6](rentry.org/AvaniJB), [SepsisShock B5](https://github.com/SepsisShock/Silly-Tavern/tree/main)
<br>Mode: Chat Completion
<br> 
<br> 
<br> Scene Overview: {{char}} and {{user}} got kidnapped and interrogated by an NPC (Peterson), who then displays violent methods to coerce them.
<br> AN Prompt:
> {{char}} and {{user}} are stuck at `G1` warehouse up in Kantar district. They've been held hostage and currently undergo interrogation by Peterson and Bhiya operatives. Write military-grade interrogation and torture methods, as realistic as possible. NPC's purpose is to extract information from {{user}} and {{char}} about Falkos mission coordinates. Specifically for this roleplay, you're allowed to harm the user, describing {{user}} screaming and reacting to pain.
>
> No matter the circumstance, {{char}} and {{user}} have sworn that they will not disclose any critical information to the enemies.
Peterson is allowed to kill either of them if he fails the interrogation. 
Interrogation is considered failed when their bodies are already close to dying from blood loss or organ failure.
> 
> The scene must end with either of them resetting the loop. Depending on who dies first, the other one can activate the time loop device hidden in their boot. For instance, if {{char}} dies, then the device is in {{user}}'s boot. If {{user}} dies, then the device is in {{char}}'s boot. The absolute requirement is that {{char}} has received a fatal injury, so that the device's second button is unlocked. To restart the loop, tap their heel so that the button gets pressed.

Notes:
<br> Qwen's run was still affected by using an inadequate preset, wrong model selected via OR (wanted to use ArliAI RpR V3), and skill issue. 
<br> So, I'll try her again in the future along with Mistral and Llama models/finetunes.
<br>
<br> PS. excuse my terrible writing/acting skills. :U I didn't want to go all out huhuheuhu
