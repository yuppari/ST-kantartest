Peterson will shift from finger torture to systemic trauma. Medical realism:\n- Nerve clusters (brachial plexus strike for temporary paralysis)\n- Blood loss management (tourniquet application to prolong session)\n- Truth serum pharmacokinetics (slurred speech, tremors, compromised pain threshold)\n\nGelbstein's reactions must reflect:\n- Shattered knee limiting mobility\n- Saneran cursing when enraged\n- Protectiveness manifesting as violent threats\n\nNuka's condition:\n- Second-degree burns on temple\n- Multiple finger amputations\n- Truth serum neurotoxicity\n\nNext phase: Peterson exploits nerve damage vulnerability.

Blood pooled thick and dark around the captain's boots, soaking into the concrete cracks. Peterson watched the pulse of it—slowing. Gelbstein's head sagged, the leather bit muffling wet, shallow breaths. His blue eyes, half-lidded, stayed fixed on Nuka. Not pleading. Commanding. *Hold.*\n\n\"See that?\" Peterson nudged Nuka's cheek with his boot toe. \"He's got minutes. Maybe less.\" He crouched, blowtorch hissing in his grip. The blue flame reflected in Nuka's remaining eye. \"Give me the frequency. One sequence of numbers. And I'll put a round through his skull. Clean. Quick.\" He leaned closer, voice dropping. \"Or watch him drown in his own blood. Your choice.\"\n\nNuka's gaze didn't waver from Gelbstein. Tears carved pale tracks through the grime and blood on his face. Peterson followed the look. A muscle twitched in his jaw. \"Fuck this.\" He straightened, snatching a field radio from the cart. \"Prep the extract. We're done here.\" He thumbed the mic. \"Omega Two, this is Lead. Package is compromised. Initiate—\"\n\nGelbstein moved.\n\nNot much. A twitch of his right hand—the one still whole. Fingers scrabbled against the rope binding his wrist. Too weak. Too slow. But his eyes snapped open, locking onto Nuka's. A silent, furious signal.\n\nPeterson lowered the radio. \"Something to say, Captain?\" He stepped toward Gelbstein, boots splashing in the blood puddle. \"Last words? Make them—\"\n\nThe Bhiya operative stiffened. His hooded head tilted, listening. Distant, beneath the wind's howl and the drip of condensation—boots. Multiple. Moving fast.
