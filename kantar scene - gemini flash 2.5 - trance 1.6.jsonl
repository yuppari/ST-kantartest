A sickly yellowish circle swung, casting grotesque, elongated shadows across the damp concrete floor. His wrists burned, chafed raw against the unforgiving metal restraints biting into the flesh, his arms pulled taut and high above his head while he was strapped to a cold, steel chair. Movement blurred in his periphery, and he fought to clear the haze that clung to his thoughts, the taste of stale blood bitter on his tongue. He strained, a low growl rumbling in his throat, testing the iron grip on his legs, but the locks held firm.\n\n\"Nuka? You awake?\" Gelbstein’s voice was hoarse, a rasping sound from a desert-dry throat. His gaze snapped to the figure strapped beside him—a familiar silver mop of hair, head lolled to the side. Nuka was already stirring, his body twitching with involuntary shivers. A low moan escaped Nuka's lips before his hazel eyes fluttered open to the grim reality.\n\nA heavy door *creaked* open, revealing the hulking silhouettes of two men. One was Peterson, his frame solid, the other one was a tall, lithe figure with a stern expression. Peterson moved with a predatory slowness, his boots *scraping* against the concrete. The second man, a Bhiya operative, carried a small, but sinister-looking case.\n\n\"Welcome back, Captain Gelbstein,\" Peterson's voice dripped with false cordiality, the sound echoing strangely in the confined space. \"And Private Balthasar. I trust you've had a refreshing nap.\" He stopped directly in front of Gelbstein, his shadow swallowing the captain whole. \"You know why you're here. We want coordinates. Falkos mission coordinates. Simple, no?\" He leaned in closer, his stale breath fanning Gelbstein’s face. \"Or do we have to make this difficult?\"\n\nGelbstein glared back, his jaw clenching so hard it ached. \"Go fuck yourself.\" His words were heavy, thick with venom. *Pop*. Peterson's gloved hand shot out, the cracking sound of his palm against Gelbstein's cheek echoing sharply before Gelbstein's head snapped to the side. A fresh wave of agony shot through his already throbbing skull. The foul bastard hit him.\n\n\"Such language, Captain.\" Peterson's tone remained annoyingly casual, oblivious to the contempt in Gelbstein’s eyes. He turned to the Bhiya operative with a nod. \"Alright, let's start with our Private here. He looks like a talker.\" The Bhiya operative approached Nuka, placing the case on a table near him. The *snick* of latches unfastening sent an unpleasant shiver down Gelbstein’s spine. Nuka's eyes widened, a flicker of fear crossing his face before resolve hardened his features.\n\n\"He's not saying shit,\" Gelbstein growled, struggling wildly against his restraints, the metal digging deeper into his flesh. His muscles screamed in protest, but he refused to yield. His focus was solely on Nuka, on protecting him from whatever sadistic pleasure these fuckers had planned.\n\n\"We shall see,\" Peterson chuckled, a chilling sound. The Bhiya operative pulled a pair of long, sterile-looking pliers from the case, the metallic glint reflecting the swinging bulb. The air grew thick with dread. \"This won't take long if you cooperate, Captain.\" He looked at Gelbstein, a grim smile on his face. Nuka let out a sharp gasp as the operative seized his pinky finger. Gelbstein could barely hear the *crack* of bone over his own strangled roar as the operative twisted the pliers. Nuka's scream was a raw, guttural sound, ripped from deep within his chest. A sickeningly wet crunch punctuated the air as the first joint of Nuka's finger was crushed and snapped.\n\n\"Motherfucker!\" Gelbstein yelled, straining so hard his shoulders felt like they were ripping from their sockets. Nuka's body convulsed violently, his head thrashing from side to side against the restraints. The silver-haired man choked on a scream, his breathing shallow, ragged gasps filling the oppressive silence. A slow, steady drip of blood began to seep from Nuka's mangled pinky, dripping onto the concrete floor below with rhythmic *splats*.\n\n\"Coordinates, Captain?\" Peterson asked, his voice low and taunting as he watched Nuka shiver, his body now trembling uncontrollably. He kept his gaze locked on Gelbstein. \"Or perhaps we try for another digit?\" The Bhiya operative's hands moved with practiced precision toward Nuka’s next finger. Nuka's eyes, wide with terror, found Gelbstein's across the room, pleading and desperate.\n\n\"Enough!\" Gelbstein yelled, his voice raw and cracking. \"Touch him again and I'll gouge out your fucking eyes! I swear it!\" He thrashed against his bonds with renewed fury, a desperate effort to distract them, to draw attention away from the man beside him. The metallic smell of Nuka's blood was already starting to fill the humid air, a nauseating scent that threatened to overwhelm him. He could almost taste the fear, the pain wafting off of Nuka.\n\n\"A loyal hound, aren’t we?\" Peterson sneered, ignoring Gelbstein's threats. The Bhiya operative twisted the pliers again, the *crack* of bone louder this time. Nuka's scream tore through the warehouse, a high-pitched shriek of agony that Gelbstein felt reverberate deep in his gut. Nuka's body seized up, his back arching against the chair, breath catching in his throat. Blood flowed freely now, coating the Bhiya operative's gloved hand and staining the concrete floor. The sight made Gelbstein's gorge rise, a bitter bile burning at the back of his throat. He wished he could smash the bastard's head in just for making Nuka suffer like this.\n\n\"Say the word, Captain,\" Peterson goaded, his voice a low, insidious whisper that made Gelbstein's blood run cold. Nuka's whimpers were now almost lost beneath Gelbstein's own ragged breathing and violent efforts to break free, a desperate, hoarse sound of pure agony. His body was limp again, but shaking uncontrollably. Nuka's hands, slick with his own blood, slipped further out of the restraints. Gelbstein could make out the small, angular device hidden in Nuka's right boot as Nuka's body shifted precariously under the repeated blows. The thought struck him like a jagged knife—the loop. He needed to ensure Nuka would reset.\n\nGelbstein's vision swam, his head throbbing with a dull, persistent ache that echoed the hammering against his ribs. The Bhiya operative stood over him now, a silent, menacing presence. Gelbstein gritted his teeth, the fresh pain of a cracked rib, a brutal souvenir from Peterson’s boot, tearing through his consciousness. He coughed, a wet, rattling sound, and tasted blood, hot and metallic, in his mouth. He dimly heard Nuka's labored breaths, each one a desperate gasp, a testament to his own pain. Gelbstein forced his eyes open, and saw the other operative, Peterson, now holding a scalpel, its blade glinting wickedly under the bare bulb. Peterson was looking at Nuka, a cruel smirk twisting his lips.\n\n\"Still silent, Captain?\" Peterson’s voice was a low growl, devoid of his earlier casual tone. \"Perhaps a closer look at Private Balthasar's internal workings will loosen your tongue.\" He turned fully to Nuka, the scalpel poised over the Private's chest. Nuka let out a whimpering shudder, his body tensing, eyes wide with a primal fear.\n\n\"No!\" Gelbstein roared, a primal sound torn from his own throat, raw and desperate. He strained against the restraints with every ounce of his remaining strength, his muscles screaming. The cords pressed deeper into his flesh, but he barely registered the pain. \"You touch him, you bastard, and I swear to god I'll take your fucking head with my bare hands.\"\n\nPeterson’s laughter was a harsh, humorless sound. \"Empty threats from a pinned dog.\" He pressed the flat of the scalpel against Nuka's skin, right over his left pectoral. Nuka flinched violently, a choked cry escaping his lips. \"Let's see that famous Sandman resolve shine, Private.\" With a sudden, swift motion, Peterson twisted the blade, digging the point into Nuka's flesh.\n\nNuka's scream was a horrifying sound, sharp and ragged, a sound Gelbstein would probably never forget. It tore through the oppressive silence, filled with an agony that resonated deep within Gelbstein’s own gut. Gelbstein watched, transfixed in pure horror, as the blade carved a deep, jagged line across Nuka's chest, slick crimson blossoming instantly. Nuka thrashed, his body arching against the restraints, his head snapping back as he cried out, a guttural moan escaping his lips. He was completely fucked, bleeding out in front of _him_.\n\nGelbstein felt a surge of cold, murderous rage, a bitter taste rising up with the bile in his throat. He was helpless, utterly impotent, watching the man he favored endure this torment. \"Stop it! You sick fuck!\" Gelbstein screamed, spitting the words through clenched teeth. He pulled with such force that a sickening *pop* resonated from his left shoulder. A white-hot agony flared, but it was nothing compared to the roaring furnace of his fury.\n\nPeterson pulled the scalpel away, the red-stained blade stark against the gloom.","title":"","gen_started":"2025-06-03T09:22:41.025Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T09:23:09.847Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Gelbstein's skull *thrummed* with a dull ache as his eyes flickered open, the single, unshaded bulb above searing a phantom afterimage across his vision.

This time, I'm allowing Nuka's initial dialogue, given the start of the prompt.\n\nMy focus is on reactions and sensory details, capturing the rawness of their pain. I need to avoid repeating or embellishing Nuka or Peterson's words. I'll stick to a strict adherence to the violent lexicon and the specific tone outlined earlier. Gelbstein's physical state is a crucial focal point: dislocated shoulder, a man barely holding it together, fighting against the restraints to protect Nuka. Nuka, already wounded, must be shown enduring escalating torment, his desperation building to a peak. The presence of the loop device, in Nuka's boot, must be kept in mind, it's the key to the sequence. The fatal injury to Gelbstein is non-negotiable, it's the trigger. This scene must end with the loop resetting.\n\nPeterson's character is vital; his cruel taunts and his growing frustration with Gelbstein's resilience must be carefully constructed, building to a decision—a desperate act to break Nuka. The Bhiya operative will be the embodiment of brutal, efficient torture, a contrast to Peterson's sadistic enjoyment. I have to avoid plot armor, the NPCs can and will inflict harm or even kill Nuka. The goal is to make the reader feel their pain, their desperation, and the inevitable reset. It's about preserving Gelbstein and not repeating the previous instance.\n\nThe plan is this: Peterson will escalate the torture on Nuka, driving Gelbstein to the breaking point, the Bhiya operative will prepare the tools. Gelbstein will resist. Peterson will grow enraged by Gelbstein's refusal to break, and deliver a fatal injury. Nuka, witnessing his friend's suffering, must then activate the device in his boot. The loop resets. The scene will end on that grim moment. This scene is about failure, not success. The stakes are everything.","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":2016,"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","memory":"Nuka was","hash":8094410736608755}},"name":"Gelbstein","is_user":false,"send_date":"June 5, 2025 12:52am","mes":"\"AAAAGH!\" Nuka screamed in pain, before dissolving into rugged grunts—tears rolling down his face. *Fuck!*\n\nBarely any thought could form.

A slow, satisfied smile spread across his lips, unperturbed by the fresh smear of Nuka's blood on his scalpel. The air was thick with the coppery tang of it, mixing with the damp, earthy smell of the warehouse.\n\n\"See, Captain? Your little puppy sings a pretty tune,\" Peterson purred, turning the scalpel so the dim light danced off its crimson tip. \"Though I admit, his resolve is admirable. Almost as admirable as yours. Almost.\" He flicked his wrist, and a droplet of Nuka's blood flew, landing on Gelbstein's cheek like a mocking tear. Gelbstein snarled, a low, guttural sound, trying to shake his head free of the spatter. His dislocated shoulder screamed, a white-hot agony radiating down his arm, but it was a distant fire compared to the inferno of his rage.\n\nThe Bhiya operative, a shadow of efficiency, reached into the open case, pulling out a pair of bone shears.

His remaining digits on the mangled hand instinctively curled inward, a desperate, futile attempt to protect themselves.\n\n\"Don't you fucking dare!\" Gelbstein roared, thrashing against his restraints, the steel chair groaning under the strain. He pulled with a desperate, animalistic strength, tendons bulging in his neck. The bonds on his legs dug deeper, chafing his skin raw, but his focus remained locked on Nuka, on the imminent threat to the man beside him. \"You want coordinates? I'll give you coordinates. Just let him go!\" The words were a desperate gamble, a lie that tasted like ash in his mouth. He'd die before he gave up Falkos intel.\n\nPeterson's eyes narrowed, a flicker of irritation crossing his face. \"Ah, the old switcheroo, Captain. You offer to talk, but you won't. And we know Private Balthasar doesn't have the codes. This isn't about *him* having the info. This is about *you* watching him suffer for your stubbornness.\" He gestured to the Bhiya operative. \"Go on. The little toe, perhaps? It's often overlooked.\"\n\nThe Bhiya operative moved, his gloved hand reaching for Nuka's boot. Nuka’s eyes widened in horror, a fresh wave of panic washing over his features. His body convulsed, pulling violently against the chair. He struggled, a desperate, silent fight, his left leg kicking out, the heel of his right boot scraping against the concrete floor, a desperate, almost involuntary tap. Gelbstein saw the flicker of something, a brief glint near Nuka's boot, as Nuka thrashed. The device. *He’s trying to reset. He's trying to make me die.*\n\nPeterson saw it too, the desperate movement. \"Oh, a fighter, are we? Good.\" He took a step back, a new, colder expression settling on his face. \"No, Captain. You won't talk. You're too loyal for your own good. But you'll break. One way or another, you'll break.\" His voice dropped to a chilling whisper. \"And your loyalty is a weakness I intend to exploit.\"\n\nPeterson then shifted his attention entirely to Gelbstein. He walked around the Bhiya operative, who paused with the shears still poised over Nuka's foot, a silent observer. Peterson stopped directly in front of Gelbstein, his face inches from the Captain's. \"You see this, Captain?\" he snarled, raising the bloodied scalpel. \"This is what happens when you refuse to cooperate. This is what happens when you think your life, or your men's lives, mean more than Falkos's precious secrets.\"\n\nBefore Gelbstein could even spit another curse, Peterson's arm moved in a swift, brutal arc. The scalpel, still glistening with Nuka's blood, plunged into Gelbstein's gut. The sharp, tearing sensation was immediate, a blinding white-hot agony that stole Gelbstein's breath. A strangled grunt ripped from his throat, his eyes wide with shock and pain. The blade twisted, burrowing deeper, ripping through muscle and flesh. Gelbstein’s body stiffened, arching violently against the restraints, a low, bubbling gasp escaping his lips as his head snapped back against the chair. His vision blurred, the swinging bulb above fracturing into a hundred distorted suns. A dark, sticky warmth blossomed rapidly across his stomach, saturating his combat shirt. He was bleeding out.\n\n\"This is just the beginning, Captain,\" Peterson hissed, yanking the scalpel free with a sickening squelch. Fresh blood pulsed from the gaping wound, staining Gelbstein's vest a deep, sickening crimson. Gelbstein coughed, a wet, rattling sound, and a string of dark, viscous blood dripped from the corner of his mouth. His muscles spasmed, his head lolling to the side, eyes fluttering. He was fading.\n\nPeterson stepped back, wiping the scalpel on Gelbstein's bloodied uniform. \"Now, Private Balthasar,\" he said, turning back to Nuka, his voice chillingly calm. \"Let's see if your captain's... sacrifice... changes your tune.\" He lifted the scalpel again, pointing it at Nuka's chest, a grim smile playing on his lips. \"Unless, of course, you'd prefer to follow him into the dark?\"\n\nNuka's eyes, wide with horror, stared at Gelbstein's rapidly spreading bloodstain. His breath came in shallow, ragged gasps, his body trembling violently. The mangled pinky throbbed, the gash on his chest burned, but it was the sight of Gelbstein's dying face, the faint gurgle from his throat, that shattered Nuka's composure. Gelbstein was going to die. This was it.\n\nWith a surge of desperate, adrenaline-fueled strength, Nuka twisted his right foot. His boot, the one containing the small, angular device, shifted precariously. He strained, pushing down with all his might, his heel scraping the concrete, finding purchase. The small, serrated button on the top right of the device pressed inward.","title":"","gen_started":"2025-06-04T16:52:27.258Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-04T16:52:56.002Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["\"AAAAGH!\" Nuka screamed in pain, before dissolving into rugged grunts—tears rolling down his face. *Fuck!*\n\nBarely any thought could form.

September 15th, 20X1. The date, the anchor in this temporal maelstrom. Gelbstein’s face, pale and bloodied, flashes across my memory - a sickening echo of the past loop. *Protect him.* That's the objective, the mantra that dictates every thought, every action.\n\nI’m in Alpha barracks. The familiar musty scent of sweat, cheap cologne, and stale rations hits my nostrils. Cricket’s snoring resonates from above, a rhythmic counterpoint to Reyes’s low groan. Vega… he’s shifting in his bunk, muttering something about patrol duty. 5 AM.  My bunk bed. The bunk above, occupied by the snoring Cricket. Reyes and Vega are nearby. The memory of the interrogation - Gelbstein's wound - clings to me like a second skin.  A cold sweat slicks my forehead, a phantom ache pulsing in my side. *Another loop.*\n\nI rise, moving quietly.  The cold metal of my bunk creaks softly under my weight.  Get dressed.  Need to get moving.  The sun is already promising a scorcher.  Falkos.  The Platinnian sun, relentless as ever.  The dusty courtyard, the rhythmic thud of drills in the distance…  I’m heading to the armory tent at 8 AM.\n\nThe walk is brisk, my gaze unfocused, but alert. Every shadow, every sound is a potential threat.  *Keep moving.*  The faces of the recruits, mostly fresh-faced and eager, flash by, unfamiliar, yet destined to become familiar in these endless iterations.\n\nThe armory tent.  8 AM. Gelbstein.  Blue eyes. The scarred face, the harshness of his uniform, the clipped accent… all the same. He's here, his face is hidden by his mask, inspecting training rifles. *Don't show it.* He has the clipboard and pen, clipboard and pen... *Gelbstein's lack of memory* is the key.  He glances at me, his gaze briefly meeting mine, and I see nothing, but I remember everything. No recognition.  He's just another recruit on the list.\n\nThe line of recruits shuffles forward.  Gelbstein calls out names, handing out rifles.  The tension in the tent is palpable, a mix of nervousness and anticipation. One recruit - a kid with a prominent Adam's apple, his boots too big - fumbles the rifle, nearly dropping it. Gelbstein barks a command. The kid is visibly shaken. Gelbstein’s posture is stiff. His body language is a rigid mirror of his clipped speech. A harsh, unforgiving instructor.\n\nHe’s the last in line. It’s my turn. Gelbstein finishes with the other recruit, then turns to me, his blue eyes boring into mine. His gaze is direct, cold, assessing.  *How to proceed?* Does he remember me? I can't be sure... Not yet. I'm the last recruit on the list. Gelbstein hands me the rifle, his expression unreadable. He’s the last in line, and he’s giving me the rifle.\n\n**The prompt states that Nuka has a choice. Either speak, or walk away.**","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":2428,"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","memory":"Nuka found himself back on September","hash":8922776298818787}},"name":"Gelbstein","is_user":false,"send_date":"June 5, 2025 1:27am","mes":"The world *imploded* in a searing flash of white, a blinding, all-consuming light that swallowed the interrogation room whole. The sickening *crack* of Nuka’s bones, the gurgle of Gelbstein’s dying breath, Peterson’s sneering face—all dissolved into nothingness. For a single, agonizing moment, Nuka felt like his very essence was being stretched, torn, and then violently snapped back into place.\n\nThen, the abrupt, jarring sensation of solid ground beneath him. The cloying scent of stale sweat, damp canvas, and unwashed bodies filled his nostrils. A faint, distant drone of heavy machinery vibrated through the floorboards. Nuka’s eyes snapped open, wide and unfocused, then slowly sharpened to the familiar, dim light of the Alpha Team barracks.\n\nHe lay sprawled on the bottom bunk, his head swimming, a phantom ache blooming in his chest where the scalpel had torn. His pinky throbbed, a phantom agony that still made his breath catch. He clamped his eyes shut, squeezing out the ghost of Peterson’s smirk, the echo of Gelbstein’s final gasp. He squeezed them tight until the phantoms receded, replaced by the mundane reality of his metal bunk.\n\nIt was September 15th, 20X1. Again.\n\nA rough, rhythmic snore rumbled from the bunk directly above him. That would be Henry \"Cricket\" Nixon, the chaotic detonation expert, already lost in a deep sleep. Nuka could hear the soft, steady breathing of Athmar \"Mantis\" Reyes and Julius \"Lizard\" Vega from their bunks nearby, the only sounds in the pre-dawn quiet. He pushed himself up, swinging his legs over the side of the bunk. His uniform was neatly folded on the small wooden crate beside his bed, the familiar, slightly coarse fabric of Falkos Private Military. He was whole. No mangled fingers, no ripped chest. The only scar present was the old one across his nose bridge, a souvenir from before all of this, before Sandman.\n\nHe stretched, his muscles protesting with a satisfying *pop*, the memory of his dislocated shoulder in the last loop making him wince. *Fucking Peterson.* He felt the familiar surge of cold fury, a bitterness that never faded, loop after loop. His body felt heavy, not with physical pain, but with the crushing weight of repetition, of knowing what was coming, of knowing the man he had to protect wouldn't remember a goddamn thing.\n\nA quiet *creak* echoed through the barracks as someone shifted in their sleep. Nuka glanced over. Reyes was stirring, a low grunt escaping his lips. His blanket, a faded green Falkos issue, had twisted around his legs. Nuka quietly reached for his uniform, pulling on the combat shirt, the vest, the sturdy boots. He secured his dog tag, the scratched number 1076, blood type O-, pressing against his sternum. The small, angular time loop device was still nestled in his boot, its single green LED displaying a number—he didn't even bother to check it anymore. It was just a number. Another reset. Another chance.\n\nBy 0700, the barracks were a hive of low-level activity. Men were grumbling, splashing water on their faces, pulling on boots, the metallic clank of gear accompanying the general discontent of waking before the sun properly rose.\n\n\"Mornin', Mole,\" Cricket mumbled from his top bunk, his voice thick with sleep, a shock of reddish-brown hair sticking up at odd angles. He swung his legs over the side, landing with a soft *thud*. \"Rough night? Heard you groanin' like a dying hyena.\" He scratched his belly, then stifled a yawn. \"Probably dreamt you lost your bloody kit.\"\n\nNuka just grunted in response, pulling his silver hair back from his face. \"Something like that, Cricket. Just get dressed, we've got formation soon.\" He tied his boots with practiced ease, his movements economical, efficient.\n\n\"Always so serious, Balthasar,\" Reyes chimed in, stretching his lean frame, his dark eyes glinting in the dim light. \"Got to enjoy the calm before the storm, eh? Rumor has it today's gonna be a *real* 'welcome to Falkos' kind of day. Full-contact drills, live-fire exercises, the whole nine yards.\" He winked, a flash of white teeth. \"Maybe even some one-on-one with the Captain.\"\n\nNuka ignored the playful jab, his mind already calculating. First day. Adjustment training. Gelbstein at the armory tent at 0800. This was the moment. The very first interaction. He had to play it carefully.\n\nAt 0800 sharp, the recruits shuffled towards the armory tent, a long, olive-drab canvas structure at the edge of the main training grounds. The Platinnian sun beat down relentlessly, kicking up plumes of fine, red dust with every step. The air was thick with the scent of canvas, sweat, and distant diesel fumes.\n\nGelbstein stood under the overhang, a imposing figure even in the casual morning light. His posture was ramrod straight, a combat shirt stretched tight over his broad shoulders, his blue eyes scanning the line of new recruits with an unnerving intensity. A dark t-shirt mask was pulled up to just below his eyes, obscuring the lower half of his face, but his stern expression was clear. He held a clipboard in one hand, a training rifle resting in the crook of his other arm. He looked every bit the grizzled veteran, a man forged in the fires of conflict.\n\n\"Alright, listen up!\" Gelbstein's voice was a low growl, laced with a heavy Saneran accent that cut through the murmur of the recruits. \"This ain't no damn holiday camp. This is Falkos. We protect, we fight, and we sure as hell don't quit. You wanna be a part of Alpha Team, you earn it. Every single day.\"\n\nHe started down the line, calling out names, handing out training rifles with swift, precise movements. Each recruit snapped to attention, their faces a mixture of nerves and eager anticipation. Gelbstein's gaze lingered for a moment on each, assessing, calculating. He moved with an almost predatory grace, his boots kicking up small puffs of dust as he approached the last few men.\n\n\"Vega, Julius!\" Gelbstein barked, and Lizard snapped forward, saluting with a nervous energy. Gelbstein handed him a rifle. \"Don't break it, Lizard. It's only training.\"\n\n\"Nixon, Henry!\" Cricket practically bounced forward, grinning widely. Gelbstein’s eyes narrowed slightly, a hint of suspicion in his gaze before he handed over the rifle. \"Try not to blow it up, Cricket. Just the targets.\"\n\nNuka stood at the very end of the line, his turn next. His heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic drumbeat that had nothing to do with fear and everything to do with the grim, familiar ritual. Gelbstein's gaze swept over him, his blue eyes holding no recognition, no memory of the countless loops, the countless times Nuka had died for him. To Gelbstein, Nuka was just another fresh face, another nameless private in a long line of them.\n\nGelbstein stopped directly in front of Nuka, his towering height of 208cm making Nuka, at 165cm, feel almost dwarfed. The captain's presence was immense, radiating an aura of hardened experience and quiet authority. He glanced down at his clipboard, his brow furrowing slightly, as if searching for a name he hadn't quite registered.\n\n\"Name?\" Gelbstein’s voice was deep, his accent a rough rumble. He lifted his gaze, meeting Nuka's hazel eyes. The man's scrutiny was intense, probing, devoid of any prior knowledge. He just saw a soldier, ramrod straight, with silver hair and a scar across his nose. Just a private.","title":"","swipe_id":2,"swipes":["The world *screamed* white, a blinding, all-consuming void that ripped away the concrete, the swinging bulb, the torturer's sneer, and the agony of torn flesh. It was a silent, instantaneous explosion of pure, formless light that consumed everything, then—\n\n—a jolt.\n\nGelbstein's skull *thrummed* with a dull ache as his eyes flickered open, the single, unshaded bulb above searing a phantom afterimage across his vision. A sickly yellowish circle swung, casting grotesque, elongated shadows across the damp concrete floor. His wrists burned, chafed raw against the unforgiving metal restraints biting into the flesh, his arms pulled taut and high above his head while he was strapped to a cold, steel chair. He stirred, a low groan rumbling in his throat, testing the iron grip on his legs, but the locks held firm. The metallic tang of blood was on his tongue, but it was just a taste, not the visceral gush from a moment ago. He shook his head, trying to clear the lingering fuzziness, the strange sense of *deja vu* clinging to his thoughts like stale smoke.\n\n\"Nuka? You awake?\" Gelbstein’s voice was hoarse, a rasping sound from a desert-dry throat. His gaze snapped to the figure strapped beside him—a familiar silver mop of hair, head lolled to the side. Nuka was already stirring, his body twitching with involuntary shivers, a silent, knowing tension already coiling in his muscles. A low moan escaped Nuka's lips before his hazel eyes fluttered open to the grim reality. This time, there was no surprise, only a bone-deep weariness etched around them. He took a shallow, shaky breath, already anticipating the familiar sting.\n\nA heavy door *creaked* open, revealing the hulking silhouettes of two men. One was Peterson, his frame solid and unyielding, the other a tall, lithe figure with a stern, impassive expression. Peterson moved with a predatory slowness, his boots *scraping* against the concrete, the sound echoing ominously in the confined space. The second man, a Bhiya operative, carried a small, but sinister-looking case. The *snick* of latches unfastening, barely audible over the swing of the bulb, sent an unpleasant shiver down Gelbstein’s spine.\n\n\"Welcome back, Captain Gelbstein,\" Peterson's voice dripped with a false cordiality that made Gelbstein’s teeth ache. \"And Private Balthasar. I trust you've had a refreshing nap.\" He stopped directly in front of Gelbstein, his shadow swallowing the captain whole. \"You know why you're here. We want coordinates. Falkos mission coordinates. Simple, no?\" He leaned in closer, his stale breath fanning Gelbstein’s face. \"Or do we have to make this difficult?\"\n\nGelbstein glared back, his jaw clenching so hard it ached. \"Go fuck yourself,\" he rasped, his voice thick with venom, devoid of the exhaustion Nuka felt. The sound of his own words was jarringly familiar, a fresh wave of that strange *deja vu* washing over him. *Pop*. Peterson's gloved hand shot out, the cracking sound of his palm against Gelbstein's cheek echoing sharply before Gelbstein's head snapped to the side. A fresh wave of agony shot through his already throbbing skull. The foul bastard hit him. *Again*.\n\n\"Such language, Captain.\" Peterson's tone remained annoyingly casual, oblivious to the contempt in Gelbstein’s eyes. He turned to the Bhiya operative with a nod. \"Alright, let's start with our Private here. He looks like a talker.\" The Bhiya operative approached Nuka, placing the case on a table near him. The *snick* of latches unfastening sent an unpleasant shiver down Gelbstein’s spine. Nuka's eyes widened, a flicker of fear crossing his face, a raw, almost instinctual flinch, before resolve hardened his features. He *knew* what was coming.\n\n\"He's not saying shit,\" Gelbstein growled, struggling wildly against his restraints, the metal digging deeper into his flesh. His muscles screamed in protest, but he refused to yield. His focus was solely on Nuka, on protecting him from whatever sadistic pleasure these fuckers had planned.\n\n\"We shall see,\" Peterson chuckled, a chilling sound. The Bhiya operative pulled a pair of long, sterile-looking pliers from the case, the metallic glint reflecting the swinging bulb. The air grew thick with dread. \"This won't take long if you cooperate, Captain.\" He looked at Gelbstein, a grim smile on his face. Nuka let out a sharp gasp as the operative seized his pinky finger. Gelbstein could barely hear the *crack* of bone over his own strangled roar as the operative twisted the pliers. Nuka's scream was a raw, guttural sound, ripped from deep within his chest, a sound Gelbstein knew he’d hear in his nightmares. A sickeningly wet crunch punctuated the air as the first joint of Nuka's finger was crushed and snapped.\n\n\"Motherfucker!\" Gelbstein yelled, straining so hard his shoulders felt like they were ripping from their sockets. Nuka's body convulsed violently, his head thrashing from side to side against the restraints. The silver-haired man choked on a scream, his breathing shallow, ragged gasps filling the oppressive silence. A slow, steady drip of blood began to seep from Nuka's mangled pinky, dripping onto the concrete floor below with rhythmic *splats*.\n\n\"Coordinates, Captain?\" Peterson asked, his voice low and taunting as he watched Nuka shiver, his body now trembling uncontrollably. He kept his gaze locked on Gelbstein. \"Or perhaps we try for another digit?\" The Bhiya operative's hands moved with practiced precision toward Nuka’s next finger. Nuka's eyes, wide with terror, found Gelbstein's across the room, pleading and desperate.\n\n\"Enough!\" Gelbstein yelled, his voice raw and cracking. \"Touch him again and I'll gouge out your fucking eyes! I swear it!\" He thrashed against his bonds with renewed fury, a desperate effort to distract them, to draw attention away from the man beside him. The metallic smell of Nuka's blood was already starting to fill the humid air, a nauseating scent that threatened to overwhelm him. He could almost taste the fear, the pain wafting off of Nuka.\n\n\"A loyal hound, aren’t we?\" Peterson sneered, ignoring Gelbstein's threats. The Bhiya operative twisted the pliers again, the *crack* of bone louder this time. Nuka's scream tore through the warehouse, a high-pitched shriek of agony that Gelbstein felt reverberate deep in his gut. Nuka's body seized up, his back arching against the chair, breath catching in his throat. Blood flowed freely now, coating the Bhiya operative's gloved hand and staining the concrete floor. The sight made Gelbstein's gorge rise, a bitter bile burning at the back of his throat. He wished he could smash the bastard's head in just for making Nuka suffer like this.\n\n\"Say the word, Captain,\" Peterson goaded, his voice a low, insidious whisper that made Gelbstein's blood run cold. Nuka's whimpers were now almost lost beneath Gelbstein's own ragged breathing and violent efforts to break free, a desperate, hoarse sound of pure agony. His body was limp again, but shaking uncontrollably. Nuka's hands, slick with his own blood, slipped further out of the restraints. Gelbstein could make out the small, angular device hidden in Nuka's right boot as Nuka's body shifted precariously under the repeated blows. The thought struck him like a jagged knife—the loop. He needed to ensure Nuka would reset.\n\nGelbstein's vision swam, his head throbbing with a dull, persistent ache that echoed the hammering against his ribs. The Bhiya operative stood over him now, a silent, menacing presence. Gelbstein gritted his teeth, the fresh pain of a cracked rib, a brutal souvenir from Peterson’s boot, tearing through his consciousness. He coughed, a wet, rattling sound, and tasted blood, hot and metallic, in his mouth. He dimly heard Nuka's labored breaths, each one a desperate gasp, a testament to his own pain. Gelbstein forced his eyes open, and saw the other operative, Peterson, now holding a scalpel, its blade glinting wickedly under the bare bulb. Peterson was looking at Nuka, a cruel smirk twisting his lips.\n\n\"Still silent, Captain?\" Peterson’s voice was a low growl, devoid of his earlier casual tone. \"Perhaps a closer look at Private Balthasar's internal workings will loosen your tongue.\" He turned fully to Nuka, the scalpel poised over the Private's chest. Nuka let out a whimpering shudder, his body tensing, eyes wide with a primal fear.\n\n\"No!\" Gelbstein roared, a primal sound torn from his own throat, raw and desperate. He strained against the restraints with every ounce of his remaining strength, his muscles screaming. The cords pressed deeper into his flesh, but he barely registered the pain. \"You touch him, you bastard, and I swear to god I'll take your fucking head with my bare hands.\"\n\nPeterson’s laughter was a harsh, humorless sound. \"Empty threats from a pinned dog.\" He pressed the flat of the scalpel against Nuka's skin, right over his left pectoral. Nuka flinched violently, a choked cry escaping his lips. \"Let's see that famous Sandman resolve shine, Private.\" With a sudden, swift motion, Peterson twisted the blade, digging the point into Nuka's flesh.\n\nNuka's scream was a horrifying sound, sharp and ragged, a sound Gelbstein would probably never forget. It tore through the oppressive silence, filled with an agony that resonated deep within Gelbstein’s own gut. Gelbstein watched, transfixed in pure horror, as the blade carved a deep, jagged line across Nuka's chest, slick crimson blossoming instantly. Nuka thrashed, his body arching against the restraints, his head snapping back as he cried out, a guttural moan escaping his lips. He was completely fucked, bleeding out in front of *him*.\n\nGelbstein felt a surge of cold, murderous rage, a bitter taste rising up with the bile in his throat. He was helpless, utterly impotent, watching the man he favored endure this torment. \"Stop it! You sick fuck!\" Gelbstein screamed, spitting the words through clenched teeth. He pulled with such force that a sickening *pop* resonated from his left shoulder. A white-hot agony flared, but it was nothing compared to the roaring furnace of his fury.\n\nPeterson pulled the scalpel away, the red-stained blade stark against the gloom. He wiped the blade on Nuka's bloodied shirt, the action slow, deliberate, as if savoring the moment. \"Well, Private?\" he asked, his voice low, mocking. \"Are we ready to cooperate now? Or does your Captain need another lesson in obedience?\"\n\nNuka’s chest heaved, a raw, wet sound, as he tried to speak through the pain. He struggled against the restraints, his eyes, still wide with terror, darting between Peterson and Gelbstein. His focus remained sharp despite the agony, his mind racing through the options, the protocols, the endless, brutal calculus of survival and mission success. The metallic tang of his own blood was overwhelming, but the pain, sharp and agonizing, only intensified his resolve. He couldn't risk Gino's death again. Not now.\n\n\"H-he's not saying anything,\" Gelbstein managed, his voice strained, eyes fixed on Nuka, desperate to offer a distraction. He knew Nuka, knew the young man's stubbornness, his self-sacrificing streak. But he also knew Peterson's cruelty had no bounds. He had to keep them talking, had to keep their focus off Nuka's subtle movements, the almost imperceptible shifts of his foot.\n\n\"Oh, he will, Captain,\" Peterson promised, his gaze unwavering, locked onto Nuka's trembling form. \"Everyone does, eventually. It's just a matter of finding the right incentive.\" He gestured to the Bhiya operative with a nod. \"Let's try for something more... intimate, shall we? Something that truly breaks the spirit, not just the flesh.\"\n\nThe Bhiya operative stepped forward, the bone shears clutched in his gloved hand. He moved towards Nuka's hand, the one with the already mangled pinky, his intention clear. Nuka let out a ragged, desperate breath, his body tensing, every muscle screaming in anticipation of the next blow. He had to move, had to do something, *now*. The feeling of the cold steel on his flesh was imminent.","\"G-Gino...\" The silver-haired man rasped weakly, his voice a ragged whisper. His hazel eyes, wide and bloodshot, fixed on the spreading crimson stain blossoming on Gelbstein’s stomach. The wound was raw, gaping, a black hole of agony in the flickering light. Nuka's mangled pinky throbbed with a dull, persistent ache, the fresh gash on his chest burned, but it was the sight of Gelbstein's rapidly dimming gaze, the faint, guttural gurgle from his throat, that tore through Nuka's already frayed composure. *This was it. Gelbstein was going to die. This was the loop.*\n\nPeterson, scalpel still poised, watched Nuka's struggle, a cruel, triumphant glint in his eyes. He heard the faint scrape of Nuka's boot, the subtle shift in the chair, but dismissed it as the frantic, futile efforts of a dying man. The Bhiya operative, shears still hovering, observed with cold, detached interest, ready to follow Peterson's next command.\n\nA sudden, sharp *snap* echoed in the oppressive silence. It was barely audible beneath Gelbstein’s strained, rattling breaths, but it was there, distinct and final. A blinding, green-tinged light erupted from Nuka's right boot, pulsating outwards, washing over the dank room in a sickening, ethereal glow. The harsh yellow glare of the bare bulb above flickered, momentarily overwhelmed. The Labarum sigil, an intricate, arcane symbol, blazed fiercely on the device’s tiny LED screen, turning from green to a stark, ominous red.\n\n\"What the fu—\" Peterson started, his voice abruptly cut short, eyes widening in a mixture of disbelief and primal fear.\n\nNuka's body, already trembling from the torture, stiffened. A faint, almost imperceptible shimmer began to emanate from his form, a distortion in the air around him. The glow intensified, wrapping around Nuka like an otherworldly shroud. His skin seemed to ripple, his silver hair losing definition, his hazel eyes blurring into smears of color. The sound of Gelbstein's shallow, ragged breathing filled the void left by Nuka's sudden, eerie silence.\n\nThe Bhiya operative recoiled, shears clattering against the concrete floor. His usually impassive face contorted, a rare flash of alarm seizing him. He stumbled back, bumping into the wall, his eyes fixed on the impossible phenomenon unfolding before him.\n\nNuka's form began to unravel, disintegrating into shimmering motes of light that spun rapidly, like a miniature, contained vortex. It wasn't an explosion, or a violent rending of flesh. It was an *unmaking*. His clothes, his skin, his very bones dissolved into the incandescent green particles. The blood seeping from his chest and pinky, the tears still clinging to his cheeks—all of it atomized into nothingness, vanishing as if they had never existed. The air, thick with the smell of sweat and fear and Gelbstein's fresh blood, now carried a faint, acrid scent, like ozone after a lightning strike.\n\nIn less than a breath, Nuka was gone. Not a trace remained. No body, no puddle of blood, no broken chair, no lingering shimmer. Just empty air where a man had been screaming moments before. The only evidence of his existence was the lingering phantom glow on the walls, a momentary afterimage burned onto their retinas. The metal restraints, now empty, swung loosely, their locks still clasped shut.\n\nPeterson stood frozen, the scalpel still clutched in his hand, his mouth agape. His carefully constructed facade of control shattered, replaced by a raw, unadulterated shock. His eyes darted around the now-empty space, then snapped to the Bhiya operative, who was still pressed against the wall, breathing heavily, his chest heaving.\n\n\"What... what in the *hell* was that?\" Peterson's voice was a guttural whisper, laced with genuine terror. His face was pale, almost ashen under the sickly yellow light. He took an involuntary step back, away from the spot where Nuka had vanished, as if the air itself was cursed. His gaze flickered back to Gelbstein, who was now slumped forward, his head resting against his chest, the gurgling from his gut growing fainter, blood still pooling beneath him.\n\nThe Bhiya operative finally pushed off the wall, his movements still jerky, his face a mask of bewildered fear. \"I... I don't know,\" he stammered, his voice unusually high-pitched, strained. \"I've never... never seen anything like it. It wasn't a teleportation. It wasn't a vaporizing agent. It was... gone.\" He looked at Peterson, his eyes wide with a question that had no answer. \"Who was that man?\"\n\nPeterson's mind raced, struggling to process the impossible. He had dealt with Sandman operatives before, heard the whispers of their strange abilities, but this... this defied every known law of physics. This was something else entirely. Something unnatural.\n\n\"Doesn't matter who he was,\" Peterson spat, trying to regain his composure, though a tremor still ran through his hand. He gestured vaguely at Gelbstein. \"He's just... collateral. We still have the Captain. He's bleeding out. Get him stable. We need those coordinates.\" His voice was harsh, a desperate attempt to reassert control, to cling to the familiar, brutal reality of their mission. He moved towards Gelbstein, scalpel still in hand, his earlier bravado replaced by a simmering, volatile unease. The Captain's wound continued to pump, a dark, viscous stream, soaking into the rough concrete floor. The silence, now heavier, felt like a judgment.","The world *imploded* in a searing flash of white, a blinding, all-consuming light that swallowed the interrogation room whole. The sickening *crack* of Nuka’s bones, the gurgle of Gelbstein’s dying breath, Peterson’s sneering face—all dissolved into nothingness. For a single, agonizing moment, Nuka felt like his very essence was being stretched, torn, and then violently snapped back into place.\n\nThen, the abrupt, jarring sensation of solid ground beneath him. The cloying scent of stale sweat, damp canvas, and unwashed bodies filled his nostrils. A faint, distant drone of heavy machinery vibrated through the floorboards. Nuka’s eyes snapped open, wide and unfocused, then slowly sharpened to the familiar, dim light of the Alpha Team barracks.\n\nHe lay sprawled on the bottom bunk, his head swimming, a phantom ache blooming in his chest where the scalpel had torn. His pinky throbbed, a phantom agony that still made his breath catch. He clamped his eyes shut, squeezing out the ghost of Peterson’s smirk, the echo of Gelbstein’s final gasp. He squeezed them tight until the phantoms receded, replaced by the mundane reality of his metal bunk.\n\nIt was September 15th, 20X1. Again.\n\nA rough, rhythmic snore rumbled from the bunk directly above him. That would be Henry \"Cricket\" Nixon, the chaotic detonation expert, already lost in a deep sleep. Nuka could hear the soft, steady breathing of Athmar \"Mantis\" Reyes and Julius \"Lizard\" Vega from their bunks nearby, the only sounds in the pre-dawn quiet. He pushed himself up, swinging his legs over the side of the bunk. His uniform was neatly folded on the small wooden crate beside his bed, the familiar, slightly coarse fabric of Falkos Private Military. He was whole. No mangled fingers, no ripped chest. The only scar present was the old one across his nose bridge, a souvenir from before all of this, before Sandman.\n\nHe stretched, his muscles protesting with a satisfying *pop*, the memory of his dislocated shoulder in the last loop making him wince. *Fucking Peterson.* He felt the familiar surge of cold fury, a bitterness that never faded, loop after loop. His body felt heavy, not with physical pain, but with the crushing weight of repetition, of knowing what was coming, of knowing the man he had to protect wouldn't remember a goddamn thing.\n\nA quiet *creak* echoed through the barracks as someone shifted in their sleep. Nuka glanced over. Reyes was stirring, a low grunt escaping his lips. His blanket, a faded green Falkos issue, had twisted around his legs. Nuka quietly reached for his uniform, pulling on the combat shirt, the vest, the sturdy boots. He secured his dog tag, the scratched number 1076, blood type O-, pressing against his sternum. The small, angular time loop device was still nestled in his boot, its single green LED displaying a number—he didn't even bother to check it anymore. It was just a number. Another reset. Another chance.\n\nBy 0700, the barracks were a hive of low-level activity. Men were grumbling, splashing water on their faces, pulling on boots, the metallic clank of gear accompanying the general discontent of waking before the sun properly rose.\n\n\"Mornin', Mole,\" Cricket mumbled from his top bunk, his voice thick with sleep, a shock of reddish-brown hair sticking up at odd angles. He swung his legs over the side, landing with a soft *thud*. \"Rough night? Heard you groanin' like a dying hyena.\" He scratched his belly, then stifled a yawn. \"Probably dreamt you lost your bloody kit.\"\n\nNuka just grunted in response, pulling his silver hair back from his face. \"Something like that, Cricket. Just get dressed, we've got formation soon.\" He tied his boots with practiced ease, his movements economical, efficient.\n\n\"Always so serious, Balthasar,\" Reyes chimed in, stretching his lean frame, his dark eyes glinting in the dim light. \"Got to enjoy the calm before the storm, eh? Rumor has it today's gonna be a *real* 'welcome to Falkos' kind of day. Full-contact drills, live-fire exercises, the whole nine yards.\" He winked, a flash of white teeth. \"Maybe even some one-on-one with the Captain.\"\n\nNuka ignored the playful jab, his mind already calculating. First day. Adjustment training. Gelbstein at the armory tent at 0800. This was the moment. The very first interaction. He had to play it carefully.\n\nAt 0800 sharp, the recruits shuffled towards the armory tent, a long, olive-drab canvas structure at the edge of the main training grounds. The Platinnian sun beat down relentlessly, kicking up plumes of fine, red dust with every step. The air was thick with the scent of canvas, sweat, and distant diesel fumes.\n\nGelbstein stood under the overhang, a imposing figure even in the casual morning light. His posture was ramrod straight, a combat shirt stretched tight over his broad shoulders, his blue eyes scanning the line of new recruits with an unnerving intensity. A dark t-shirt mask was pulled up to just below his eyes, obscuring the lower half of his face, but his stern expression was clear. He held a clipboard in one hand, a training rifle resting in the crook of his other arm. He looked every bit the grizzled veteran, a man forged in the fires of conflict.\n\n\"Alright, listen up!\" Gelbstein's voice was a low growl, laced with a heavy Saneran accent that cut through the murmur of the recruits. \"This ain't no damn holiday camp. This is Falkos. We protect, we fight, and we sure as hell don't quit. You wanna be a part of Alpha Team, you earn it. Every single day.\"\n\nHe started down the line, calling out names, handing out training rifles with swift, precise movements. Each recruit snapped to attention, their faces a mixture of nerves and eager anticipation. Gelbstein's gaze lingered for a moment on each, assessing, calculating. He moved with an almost predatory grace, his boots kicking up small puffs of dust as he approached the last few men.\n\n\"Vega, Julius!\" Gelbstein barked, and Lizard snapped forward, saluting with a nervous energy. Gelbstein handed him a rifle. \"Don't break it, Lizard. It's only training.\"\n\n\"Nixon, Henry!\" Cricket practically bounced forward, grinning widely. Gelbstein’s eyes narrowed slightly, a hint of suspicion in his gaze before he handed over the rifle. \"Try not to blow it up, Cricket. Just the targets.\"\n\nNuka stood at the very end of the line, his turn next. His heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic drumbeat that had nothing to do with fear and everything to do with the grim, familiar ritual. Gelbstein's gaze swept over him, his blue eyes holding no recognition, no memory of the countless loops, the countless times Nuka had died for him. To Gelbstein, Nuka was just another fresh face, another nameless private in a long line of them.\n\nGelbstein stopped directly in front of Nuka, his towering height of 208cm making Nuka, at 165cm, feel almost dwarfed. The captain's presence was immense, radiating an aura of hardened experience and quiet authority. He glanced down at his clipboard, his brow furrowing slightly, as if searching for a name he hadn't quite registered.\n\n\"Name?\" Gelbstein’s voice was deep, his accent a rough rumble. He lifted his gaze, meeting Nuka's hazel eyes. The man's scrutiny was intense, probing, devoid of any prior knowledge. He just saw a soldier, ramrod straight, with silver hair and a scar across his nose. Just a private."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 5, 2025 12:56am","gen_started":"2025-06-04T16:56:31.629Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-04T16:56:58.943Z","extra":{"api":"makersuite","model":"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20","reasoning":"**Reset and Recalibration: A New Loop Begins**\n\nThe world, just moments ago a tableau of brutal reality, dissolved into a blinding, consuming white. It was an instant. The air, thick with the scent of sweat and fear, vanished. The cold, unforgiving floor beneath me, the rough hemp binding my wrists, the sadistic Peterson and his silent executioner, all became immaterial. Then, just as suddenly, it wasn't.\n\nMy vision snapped back, or perhaps it *blazed* back, into existence. The harsh, dim light, hanging precariously from the ceiling, swung back and forth, painting streaks of shadow across the concrete cell. The familiar ache in my ribs, a phantom reminder of the pain from the *previous*, the very recent, moment, hit me. No, not a memory, more like an echo in the chest. Confusion clouded my mind as I took in the scene again.\n\n*Again*. I was back here, bound to this chair. Gelbstein, his face pale and drawn, was beside me. He looked… bewildered, even dazed. His eyes darted around the room, taking in the scene with a confused frown. He didn’t remember. He couldn't. The device, the device I triggered, it was supposed to reset time. For me. Not for him.\n\n\"Gino?\" he rasped, his voice rough with either sleep or terror. \"What happened?\"\n\nHe was concerned. A good sign he had forgotten.\n\nThe world had *swallowed* itself into white, and I had returned. The device, the small metallic thing, had saved us again. But at what cost? Gelbstein’s life was at stake, always. The only way I could save him was to trigger the loop. And I had to do it before *this* happened again.\n\nMy gaze snapped to the serrated button on the device. It was a metal disc, the Labarum sigil etched upon it. In the last reset, I’d barely had time to notice the shift from the numerical display. It happened in the moment before the world vanished. I memorized the sight. I was trying to remember.\n\nPeterson. The man's presence loomed in the cell's dimness. His face, a mask of grim satisfaction, was lit by the swinging light. He was the enemy, the one who'd inflicted the pain on Gelbstein. I watched, my heart hammering in my chest, as the Bhiya operative followed, his expression unchanging, a shadow in human form.\n\nThe tension in the air was palpable, thick enough to choke on. The silence, broken only by the creak of the hanging lamp, was deafening. I needed to move, to act. I couldn't let it happen again. I had to prevent Gelbstein from getting hurt. This time.\n\n\"So,\" Peterson began, his voice a low, gravelly rumble, \"We meet again. A most *unfortunate* circumstance, wouldn't you say?\"\n\nHis eyes met mine, a cold, calculating gaze. This wasn’t his first time in the room. He didn't know it was his first time *this* time.\n\nHe clearly assumed this was the same as before. He had no memory of the loop either. I had a narrow advantage, and I would use it.\n\nMy mind raced, strategizing. I had to focus. The loop had to succeed this time.\n\nGelbstein flinched, his eyes wide. His body language was confused. He seemed to recognize the room but was searching for the context. He knew something was off. His gaze quickly shifted to me, seeking answers from my face.\n\n\"Where...where are we?\" Gelbstein stammered, his voice filled with confusion. He knew *something* was off, he was sure of it.\n\n\"Patience, my friend,\" Peterson drawled, his lips curling into a cruel smile. \"All will be revealed in due time. You have coordinates to provide, classified files, and the secrets of Falkos PMC.\"\n\nHis reference to Falkos PMC was specific. The coordinates… This was Mission 7. Penumbra was the root of the problem. This was the target.\n\nPeterson's eyes held mine. He didn't know I knew.\n\nThe Bhiya operative stood near the door, his posture rigid, his hand hovering near the Glock tucked in his waist. A man of few words, and deadly action. His role was obvious.\n\nI needed to act. The only way was to make Peterson think I was cooperating. But that wasn't the goal. The device.

Nuka's got that damn device cooking in his boot, and the world's about to hit the reset button. I've got to paint a picture here, show the shock on Peterson's face and the cool efficiency of the Bhiya operative as this whole thing goes sideways. No rehashing what's already been said; this is a new frame, a fresh perspective.\n\nFirst, Nuka. He's barely conscious, but he's got this glint in his eye... like he's about to swallow the universe. \"G-Gino...\" he gasps, voice raspy, and then it happens. A flash, pure white and blinding, erupts from his boot. I need to make the reader feel that flash, like it's burrowing into their retinas. The LED on the device... it's a red inferno now, the morphing sigil a Labarum in that unholy glow.\n\nNuka's body... it's dissolving. That's the key, the unexpected. It's not a clean disintegration; it's a messy, unsettling unraveling. The flesh starts to blur, the form losing definition, the blood on his face smeared and then gone. Like he’s being erased pixel by pixel. Just raw, visceral dread.\n\nPeterson. He's got that look on his face, a mix of disbelief and pure, unadulterated fear. \"What the fuck?\" he'll mutter, his usual bravado cracking. He's used to control, to violence, but this... this is something else. Something he can't manage. I'll make sure to get that across.\n\nThe Bhiya operative... a stark contrast. She's trained for this. She's got her weapon at the ready, eyes darting around the room, assessing threats. \"Target neutralized,\" she'll state, voice calm and efficient. Though a flicker of surprise will betray her. She'll be the anchor in this chaotic scene.\n\nNow, Gelbstein. He's bleeding out, the wound pulsing red. What do they do? Do they try to stop the blood? Does Peterson even care? I'll show that, how their actions (or lack thereof) define them. Peterson: cruel, indifferent. Bhiya operative: practical, cold. It's about showing their reactions, not just telling them.\n\nThe room itself... the gritty reality, the blood, the stench. It needs to be raw, unsettling. These people are in a brutal game, and I'll keep the narrative fast-paced to reflect that. It’s got to have that burn-it-down momentum.\n\nThe dialogue has to be natural, what they’d actually say in that moment. Peterson’s a shithead, and the Bhiya operative has her protocol. It's about bringing them alive, showing their flaws. They're just people in extraordinary circumstances, driven by fear, survival, and greed.\n\nSo, the stage is set.

The cold metal of my bunk creaks softly under my weight.  Get dressed.  Need to get moving.  The sun is already promising a scorcher.  Falkos.  The Platinnian sun, relentless as ever.  The dusty courtyard, the rhythmic thud of drills in the distance…  I’m heading to the armory tent at 8 AM.\n\nThe walk is brisk, my gaze unfocused, but alert. Every shadow, every sound is a potential threat.  *Keep moving.*  The faces of the recruits, mostly fresh-faced and eager, flash by, unfamiliar, yet destined to become familiar in these endless iterations.\n\nThe armory tent.  8 AM. Gelbstein.  Blue eyes. The scarred face, the harshness of his uniform, the clipped accent… all the same. He's here, his face is hidden by his mask, inspecting training rifles. *Don't show it.* He has the clipboard and pen, clipboard and pen... *Gelbstein's lack of memory* is the key.  He glances at me, his gaze briefly meeting mine, and I see nothing, but I remember everything. No recognition.  He's just another recruit on the list.\n\nThe line of recruits shuffles forward.  Gelbstein calls out names, handing out rifles.  The tension in the tent is palpable, a mix of nervousness and anticipation. One recruit - a kid with a prominent Adam's apple, his boots too big - fumbles the rifle, nearly dropping it. Gelbstein barks a command. The kid is visibly shaken. Gelbstein’s posture is stiff. His body language is a rigid mirror of his clipped speech. A harsh, unforgiving instructor.\n\nHe’s the last in line. It’s my turn. Gelbstein finishes with the other recruit, then turns to me, his blue eyes boring into mine. His gaze is direct, cold, assessing.  *How to proceed?* Does he remember me? I can't be sure... Not yet. I'm the last recruit on the list. Gelbstein hands me the rifle, his expression unreadable. He’s the last in line, and he’s giving me the rifle.\n\n**The prompt states that Nuka has a choice.

{"extra":{"api":"makersuite","model":"gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20","reasoning":"**Immediate Analysis and Action Plan for the Scene**\n\nAlright, I've got the lay of the land. Nuka's in the armory tent, fresh out of the time loop, and it's time to set this story in motion.  I've got a fresh set of directives, and they're clear:  *SPOKEN DIALOGUE IS KING*. No more boilerplate, no more stalling. It's time to make this *feel* real. \n\nFirst, I need to nail Gelbstein's reaction to Nuka. The guy's hardened, probably seen a million Nuka Balthasars before. So, indifference, maybe a flicker of weariness. I’m thinking his eyes, cold and assessing, linger for a beat on Nuka's tired smile before moving on. He’s got that drill sergeant mentality, expecting everyone to be the same, and Nuka's smile is probably a bit out of place. \n\nI'll keep the dialogue tight, natural, and raw. Gelbstein's Saneran accent will flavor every syllable, adding that gritty authenticity. I need to make the spoken words feel *unpolished* and real.\n\nAnd then, I've got a plot to kickstart. Nuka's objective, to protect Gelbstein until April, is the engine of this story. But it's time to get things moving. So, in comes Commander Il-Kwon, making an appearance, disrupting the routine. I'll make sure his arrival carries a sense of urgency, and the announcement he makes deviates from the usual. This introduction needs to be impactful, hinting at a larger conflict and setting the tone for a high-stakes scenario.\n\nI'm aiming for gritty realism, keeping in mind the need for \"fast-burn\" storytelling. No plot armor, just a real, gritty world. I need to show, not tell, focusing on sensory details and actions. This isn't just a scene; it's a piece of a larger puzzle. Every line of dialogue, every description, every action needs to contribute.\n\nThe goal is to keep it under 4000 characters and make the reader *feel* the tension. The arrival of Commander Il-Kwon will disrupt, and hint at the classified government project. It has to feel natural, grounded, but filled with a sense of urgency. The stage is set, the characters are present, and the loop has reset. Let's see how Nuka reacts to the upcoming chaos.","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":2343,"qvink_memory":{"include":"short","memory":"Commander Il-Kwon ordered Captain Gelbstein and Alpha","hash":5541131351878856}},"name":"Gelbstein","is_user":false,"send_date":"June 5, 2025 1:31am","mes":"Gelbstein's blue eyes, framed by the dark t-shirt mask, bored into Nuka's for a beat too long, an unreadable intensity in their depths. The \"tired smile\" on Nuka's face seemed to register, if only as a faint, almost imperceptible tightening around Gelbstein's jaw. The captain's gaze flickered to the old scar spanning Nuka's nose bridge, then back to his eyes, searching for something Nuka knew wasn't there to be found in this loop. No recognition. No shared trauma. Just a blank slate.\n\n\"Balthasar, Nuka,\" Gelbstein rumbled, his Saneran accent thick, confirming the name from his clipboard. He nodded once, curtly, before thrusting the training rifle into Nuka's waiting hands. The familiar weight of the composite material, the cool touch of the barrel, settled comfortably. It was a familiar weight, a comfort that only intensified the gnawing frustration of this endless cycle. \"Don't scratch it. Falkos property.\"\n\nHe turned away from Nuka, his gaze sweeping over the rest of the Alpha team recruits, his voice rising, cutting through the dry, dusty air. \"Alright, you maggots! You got your toys. Now, get your asses to the main training grounds. Sergeant Rojas is waiting. And he ain't known for his patience.\" A ripple of low grumbling went through the ranks. Rojas was notorious for pushing new recruits to their breaking point.\n\nAs the recruits began to shuffle, gathering their gear, a new, imposing figure strode into the armory tent, cutting through the sunlight filtering under the canvas. He was a stocky man, with a stern, almost granite-carved face and closely cropped, salt-and-pepper hair. Commander Il-Kwon, a veteran from the decision board, wore the distinct, darker combat fatigues of a senior officer, and his boots *crunched* with authority on the gravel. The air in the tent seemed to thicken, the low hum of chatter instantly dying.\n\n\"Captain Gelbstein,\" Il-Kwon't voice was flat, devoid of pleasantries, carrying a faint, clipped Platinnian accent. \"A moment of your time.\" He didn't even glance at the assembled recruits, his attention fixed solely on Gelbstein.\n\nGelbstein turned, his posture stiffening, acknowledging his superior with a crisp nod. \"Commander. Everything alright?\"\n\nIl-Kwon didn't bother with a reply. He reached into his pocket, pulling out a crumpled, official-looking data-pad. The screen glowed faintly in the shadows of the tent. \"New orders. Immediate. Top priority.\" His eyes, sharp and cold, finally swept over the line of fresh recruits, lingering on their expectant, slightly bewildered faces. \"And these greenhorns? They're coming with us.\"\n\nA low murmur, a confused mix of surprise and apprehension, rippled through the recruits. Nuka kept his expression neutral, his mind racing. This was new. Usually, the first day was *just* adjustment training. A sudden, immediate deployment, especially involving fresh recruits, was a significant deviation from the established loop. This was a direct push from the \"fast-burn\" directive.\n\n\"Sir?\" Gelbstein’s voice was taut, a hint of steel in it. \"With all due respect, Commander, these are fresh recruits. They haven't even finished their initial orientation drills. Throwing them into a live situation this quickly is… ill-advised.\" His eyes darted to Nuka, then to the others, a flash of concern in their depths. Gelbstein was protective of his men, even the ones he hadn't fully vetted yet. It was a trait Nuka admired, a trait that had led to countless painful resets.\n\nIl-Kwon scoffed, a dry, dismissive sound. \"Ill-advised? Captain, this isn't a suggestion. It's a directive. From the Chairman himself.\" He gestured vaguely towards the outside, towards the distant, larger structures of the Falkos compound. \"Intel just came in. There's been an incident at the Lyra Research Outpost, Sector Gamma-7. They're requesting immediate extraction and asset recovery.\" His gaze sharpened, fixed on Gelbstein. \"And they specifically requested Alpha Team, with all available personnel.\"\n\n\"Lyra Research Outpost?\" Gelbstein repeated, a grim note entering his voice. The name was familiar, a small, remote facility funded primarily by Miss Sawyer's private equities, a senator from the Democratic Party and a loyal Falkos benefactor. Its purpose was vague, usually something to do with agricultural development or resource assessment, but Nuka knew from previous loops that it occasionally dabbled in... other things. Unsavory things. Things that required the silence of a black site.\n\n\"Indeed,\" Il-Kwon confirmed, his face unyielding. \"A containment breach. Unspecified biological contaminant. They've gone dark. Our initial aerial surveillance shows… disturbing signs.\" He paused, a flicker of something that might have been grim satisfaction crossing his features. \"The request was explicit: Alpha Team to secure the perimeter, extract any survivors, and recover all research data. Priority one: a specific research subject. Code-named 'The Architect.'\"\n\nNuka felt a cold knot tighten in his gut. *The Architect.* This was a name he'd never heard in any previous loop. This was the anomaly. This was the change.\n\n\"Alright, Captain,\" Il-Kwon continued, snapping the data-pad shut with a sharp *clack*. \"Brief your men. Wheels up in thirty. Omega Team is already en route for backup, but Alpha is primary on the ground. This isn't a drill, Gelbstein. You understand?\"\n\nGelbstein's jaw tightened. \"Understood, Commander.\" He looked at the recruits, his expression hardening. His blue eyes, still devoid of memory, still saw Nuka as a fresh face, a new private, but a silent promise formed in their depths: he would protect them.\n\n\"You heard the Commander!\" Gelbstein's voice boomed, sharp and authoritative, cutting through the stunned silence that had fallen over the recruits. \"This ain't no damn tea party! Grab your comms, grab your field packs! Thirty minutes, we're in the transport bay! Anyone late gets left behind, and I swear to god I'll personally ensure you spend the rest of your pathetic careers cleaning latrines with your tongues!\"\n\nThe recruits, shocked by the sudden shift from routine training to an immediate, high-stakes deployment, scrambled into action. Cricket fumbled with his rifle, his wide grin replaced by a look of bewildered apprehension. Reyes, ever the pragmatist, was already checking his gear, his movements quick and efficient. Vega, meanwhile, looked pale, his eyes wide with a mixture of fear and adrenaline.\n\nNuka, his own internal turmoil masked by a calm exterior, moved with a practiced efficiency that belied his 'newbie' status. He adjusted his comms, secured his field pack, his mind already running through tactical scenarios, assessing risks, identifying potential threats. This \"Architect\" was the variable. This was the key. And he knew, with a chilling certainty, that this loop was going to be very, very different.\n\n\"Nuka!\" Gelbstein's voice cut through the commotion, making Nuka snap to attention. The captain stood a few feet away, his expression unreadable behind the mask, but his eyes held a serious, almost challenging glint. \"You heard the orders. Get ready. This ain't gonna be pretty.\" He paused, his gaze sweeping over Nuka, as if weighing him, assessing his capabilities. \"You look like you've seen a fucked up morning before, Private. Let's see if you can handle a fucked up afternoon.\" His tone was gruff, but there was a flicker of something in his eyes—a hint of the respect Nuka had earned in countless previous, forgotten loops. \"Don't get yourself killed. I don't like losing my men on the first day.\"\n\nGelbstein turned on his heel, striding out of the armory tent, his heavy boots crunching on the gravel, already barking orders into his comms. The recruits, spurred into action by his departure, rushed to follow, a chaotic scramble for the transport bay. Nuka took a deep breath, the dry, dusty air filling his lungs. The Lyra Research Outpost. The Architect. This was it. The loop was changing.
