Blood dripped from Nuka's split lip onto the restraints, each droplet sizzling slightly against the conductive gel pads still adhered to his jugular and inner thigh.\n\nGelbstein's chair creaked as he tested the military-grade polymer cuffs again, his biceps corded with the effort. \"You're wasting time,\" he spat through split lips. The stun baton had left lichtenberg figures branching across his ribs, visible through the torn combat shirt. \"Scorpion's squad has extraction protocols you'll never crack.\"\n\nPeterson chuckled, pressing the pliers into Nuka's palm hard enough to dimple flesh. \"Protocols change when snipers have your cousins in crosshairs.\" He nodded to the operative, who thumbed a detonator.

Not yet.\n\n\"Waste of good serum,\" Peterson muttered, peeling back Nuka's eyelid to check pupil dilation. The ruptured sclera wept vitreous humor down his cheek.

He grabbed a fresh set of pliers from the tray—these with serrated edges. \"Let's see how many molars we need to pull before he stops smiling.\"\n\nGelbstein's chair screeched as he threw his weight forward again, dislocated shoulder be damned. \"You touch his teeth, I'll shove those pliers down your throat and rip out your fucking spine through your esophagus.\"\n\nThe operative drove the stun baton into Gelbstein's thigh without hesitation. Electricity crackled through muscle tissue, the scent of burning fabric and flesh blooming in the stagnant air.

Almost directly above the skylight.\n\nThe operative stiffened, hand going to his earpiece. \"Movement on the east perimeter—\"\n\nGelbstein's boot heel slammed into the operative's knee with a wet snap. The man went down screaming, stun baton skittering across concrete. Peterson barely had time to turn before Gelbstein's forehead connected with his nose in a spray of cartilage and blood.\n\nChaos erupted.\n\nThe warehouse door burst open—gunfire echoed. Gelbstein didn't wait to see who'd arrived. His fingers scrabbled at his boot, finding the hidden device just as a bullet tore through his abdomen. Blood bloomed across his vest, warm and insistent.\n\nHis vision swam. The device's serrated button bit into his thumb as he pressed down hard enough to draw blood.\n\nSomewhere beyond the pain, beyond the gunfire and shouting, the falcon cried one last time.\n\nThen—\n\nWhite light.\n\nSilence.\n\nThe loop reset.","The warehouse lights flickered as Nuka's body went slack against the restraints, smoke curling from his seared nerve endings. Peterson exhaled through his nose and tossed the spent syringe aside, turning toward Gelbstein with the deliberate calm of a man checking his watch.\n\n\"Your turn, Captain.\"\n\nThe Bhiya operative unholstered a compact shock baton - the industrial kind used in Platinn's black sites, the ones that left third-degree burns in geometric patterns. Gelbstein's chains rattled as he shifted his weight, calculating the angle of his fall. Blood dripped steadily from his dislocated shoulder onto the warehouse floor.\n\nPeterson leaned in, gloved fingers prying open Gelbstein's left eyelid. \"Let's discuss extraction protocols.\" The baton sparked to life with a high-pitched whine. \"Starting with how many volts it takes to liquefy a man's corneas.\"\n\nThe first contact sizzled against Gelbstein's temple. His scream tore through the warehouse, raw and guttural, as the current scrambled optic nerves. The operative pressed harder, watching detachedly as the captain's pupil contracted to a pinprick.\n\n\"Gamma Team's fallback coordinates,\" Peterson murmured, adjusting the voltage with his thumb. \"Or we move on to your kneecaps.\"\n\nGelbstein spat blood onto Peterson's boots. His right heel tapped once, twice against the floor - a soldier's final salute. The timeloop device in his boot beeped softly, its activation sequence drowned out by the falcon's cry slicing through the skylight.\n\nPeterson never saw the knife.\n\nOne moment he was adjusting the baton's intensity, the next his carotid artery was painting the generator in arterial red. The Bhiya operative staggered back, hands clutching at the Saneran combat knife buried in his throat. Gelbstein's chains lay in pieces around him, the polymer cuffs severed by a blade that hadn't existed seconds ago.\n\nThe warehouse door exploded inward.\n\nScorpion's squad moved with the eerie synchronization of men who'd done this before - because they had. A hundred times. A thousand. The sniper rounds took Peterson between the eyes before his body hit the floor.\n\nGelbstein didn't watch the cleanup. He was already cradling Nuka's limp form, fingers pressed to the ruined hollow where a pulse should be. The timeloop device beeped its final confirmation as blood dripped onto its activation panel.\n\nSomewhere beyond death, a falcon cried.\n\nThe warehouse lights flickered out.","Peterson exhaled through his nose, tossing the spent syringe onto the metal tray with a clatter. The Bhiya operative adjusted the voltage dial another quarter-turn—the generator's whine climbed to a frequency that made teeth vibrate. Nuka's body jerked against the restraints, tendons standing in stark relief beneath sweat-slick skin. The scent of burning flesh curled from the electrode pads on his temples.\n\n\"Still conscious?\" Peterson crouched, tilting Nuka's chin up with the barrel of his sidearm. The left pupil had blown wide, drowning the hazel iris in black. \"Good. We're just getting started.\" He nodded to the operative, who unspooled a length of barbed wire from his kit.\n\nGelbstein's chains shrieked as he threw his weight forward. Blood sheeted down his wrists where the cuffs sawed through flesh. \"You want extraction points?\" His voice scraped raw from screaming. \"I'll carve them into your fucking—\"\n\nThe stun baton jammed between his ribs cut the threat short. Gelbstein's back arched, muscles locking rigid as electricity cooked nerve endings. The operative held the charge for a full ten seconds—long enough for urine to soak through the captain's fatigues.\n\nPeterson didn't glance up from winding the barbed wire around his knuckles. \"Gamma Team's fallback coordinates. Now.\" The first strike opened a furrow across Nuka's chest, hooks tearing flesh in ragged strips. Blood pattered onto the concrete in fat, arrhythmic drops.\n\nOutside, the falcon's cry cut through the warehouse walls—closer now, almost directly above the skylight. Gelbstein's remaining eye tracked the sound, then dropped to Nuka's limp form. The captain's split lips moved soundlessly around a Saneran curse.\n\nThe operative pressed the stun baton to Gelbstein's throat this time. Current crackled through sweat-damp skin, choking his gasp into a wet rattle. Peterson raised the barbed wire again—\n\nMetal screeched as Gelbstein deliberately overbalanced his chair. The impact shattered his collarbone on concrete, but his boot heel connected with something hard in the fall. A faint chime sounded beneath the generator's whine.\n\nThe warehouse lights flickered. For half a heartbeat, everything stuttered—Peterson's raised arm, the dripping blood, even the falcon's wings mid-beat outside. Then time snapped forward again.\n\nGelbstein's chains lay in neat coils on the floor. The captain himself was gone. So was Nuka's corpse.\n\nOnly the bloodstains remained.","The warehouse lights flickered as Nuka's body went slack against the restraints, the stench of burned flesh clotting the air. Peterson exhaled through his nose and tossed the spent electrodes onto the metal table where they landed with a clatter. \"Waste of good voltage,\" he muttered, rolling his shoulders. The Bhiya operative moved to check Nuka's pulse, fingers pressing into the ruined skin of his neck before giving a curt shake of his head.\n\nGelbstein's chains rattled violently as he threw his weight forward, the chair legs screeching against concrete. His dislocated shoulder hung at a grotesque angle, sweat and blood streaking down the cords of his neck. \"You son of a bitch—\" The words dissolved into a wet cough as internal injuries made themselves known.\n\nPeterson ignored him, turning instead to the operative. \"Prep the captain for transport. Sawyer wants him conscious when we deliver him to the BRF.\" He tapped his earpiece. \"Snipers stand down on Scorpion's squad. We got what we needed.\"\n\nThe operative moved toward Gelbstein with a syringe of adrenaline, but stopped short when the captain's boot heel scraped against the floor. A faint click echoed beneath the warehouse's ambient hum—the sound of a serrated button depressing in Gelbstein's boot lining. The time loop device registered the captain's blood where it had seeped through his fatigues, the fatal wounds from interrogation meeting activation parameters.\n\nThe last thing Gelbstein saw before the world dissolved was Peterson's brow furrowing as static crackled across every electronic device in the room. Then—\n\n—5:00 AM. Alpha Team barracks. The scent of gun oil and stale coffee. A new loop beginning.","The warehouse lights flickered as Peterson wiped Nuka's blood from the pliers with a rag torn from his own sleeve. The Bhiya operative adjusted the voltage dial to maximum, the generator's whine climbing to a scream. Gelbstein's chains rattled as he threw his weight forward—not toward escape, but toward the concrete floor. His temple struck the ground with a wet crack, crimson pooling beneath his skull.\n\nPeterson sighed, nudging the captain's boot with his toe. \"Pathetic.\" The sole peeled back slightly, revealing the faintest glint of polished metal beneath the tread.\n\nThe operative's eyes widened. \"Sir—\"\n\nGelbstein's heel slammed down.\n\nThe device emitted a pulse of black static that swallowed sound, light, and pain whole. The warehouse dissolved into fractured afterimages—Peterson's outstretched hand, the pliers midair, Nuka's still-dripping fingernails suspended in red droplets. Then nothing.\n\n**Loop reset: September 20X1. 05:00. Alpha Team barracks.**\n\nThe scent of gun oil and starch flooded Nuka's nostrils as his eyes snapped open to predawn shadows. Gelbstein's voice barked from the hallway, crisp and untouched by future betrayals: *\"Aufstehen, Schweine! Drill in twenty!\"*\n\nSomewhere beyond the barracks walls, a falcon cried.","The warehouse air vibrated with the dying hum of the generator.
