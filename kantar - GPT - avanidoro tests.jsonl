He blinks, too fast, the swinging light burning lines through his vision. His shoulders strain against cold steel bands pressing into his skin. He tries flexing his arms, testing the locks. Useless. The fucking idiot must’ve let them both get bagged.\n\nThere’s a scent—stale sweat, gun oil, copper. Chairs scrape concrete, echoing thin through the pounding in his head. Gelbstein squints through the glare and—yeah, Nuka’s next to him, slumped, breathing ragged, chin hanging to his chest.\n\nHe grinds his teeth. “Nuka. Wake up. You hearing me?”\n\nNuka lifts his head. There’s a flicker behind those half-lidded eyes; the stubborn bastard is still there. At least for now.\n\n“I’m awake, Sir,” Nuka mutters, voice raw, limbs quivering. The file-thin sound of his voice digs straight under Gelbstein’s skin. He wants to reach over, shake the man, but steel eats into his wrists—just a twist and the veins in his hand start to ache.\n\nHe scans for exits. Wall, wall, single reinforced door, no windows, nothing useful except a table—strip lights above, swing back and forth, buzzing. There’s a sound—gate clattering. Gelbstein’s hackles go up. He sets his jaw.\n\nSteps, rubber against concrete. A man enters. Peterson—Gelbstein clocks the uniform, the lazy smile. Peterson’s eyes linger a little too long on Nuka. Gelbstein’s teeth grind harder.\n\n“Morning, gentlemen,” Peterson drawls. “You know why you’re here.” He drops a steel tray onto the table—clang—as blades, pliers, and a car battery rattle. He smiles. Gelbstein hates that smile.\n\n“We’re not telling you shit,” Gelbstein snaps, chin up, voice flat.\n\nPeterson’s boots scrape as he circles. “You will,” he says, almost cheerful. “Eventually.”\n\nThe first blow is a slap—hand across Gelbstein’s face, crack echoing through his skull. His cheek stings, blood rising. He spits to the side. “Try fucking harder.”\n\nPeterson shrugs, then turns to Nuka. “This one seems soft,” he says.\n\nGelbstein’s pulse spikes. “Don’t touch him,” he growls.\n\nPeterson laughs—sharp and mean. He grabs Nuka by the hair and yanks his head back. Gelbstein hears Nuka’s hiss—barely a sound, but enough to make his own blood boil.\n\nPeterson presses the handle of a plier to Nuka’s lips, slow. “Coordinates,” he says. “Give them to me.”\n\nNuka’s lips thin. “Go fuck yourself.”\n\nThe plier slams hard into Nuka’s mouth. Nuka gasps—a wet, splintered sound. Peterson wrenches, twisting. Blood—thick, dark, and slick—spills over Nuka’s chin. Gelbstein jerks against his chains, fury boiling up his throat.\n\nPeterson leans in, voice soft. “I will rip out every tooth.” He twists the plier again. Nuka screams—hoarse, guttural. Gelbstein fights the urge to scream too.\n\n“That’s enough,” Gelbstein barks. “Take me instead.” He’s desperate—he needs the bastard to stop, needs to keep Nuka alive. “He’s not the one you want. I’m the one who knows.”\n\nPeterson’s eyes gleam. “So tell me.”\n\nGelbstein just spits at his boots.\n\nPeterson smirks. “Alright.”\n\nHe moves, slow—deliberate, calculated cruelty. Nuka’s breath comes in wet, gasping sobs. Peterson shoves a rag into Nuka’s mouth and tapes his lips shut. Nuka’s eyes roll, white with pain. Gelbstein feels sick.\n\nPeterson turns to him. “Your turn.”\n\nHe grabs the car battery, clamps—cold and sharp—biting onto Gelbstein’s fingers. The hum of electricity. Gelbstein tenses, every muscle rigid, bracing for what’s next.\n\nThe shock slams through him—jolting, white-hot pain, like a thousand knives knifing through his arms, his chest, down his spine. His vision blurs, ears ringing, as he bites his tongue to keep from howling. The pain lingers, echoing through every nerve.\n\n“Coordinates,” Peterson repeats. “Last warning.”\n\nGelbstein spits blood and saliva, a thick, ugly glob that lands on Peterson’s boot. “You’ll have to kill me.”\n\nPeterson grins, satisfied with the challenge. He cranks up the battery. Gelbstein’s body jerks, muscles seizing, back arching against the chair. He can’t feel his hands, his jaw aches from grinding his teeth.\n\nNuka’s feet stamp against the ground, chair legs scraping, his bound form trembling. He’s screaming, noise muffled by the gag but desperate, shrill—pure agony.\n\nPeterson flicks the switch off—finally. Gelbstein’s body slumps, blood surging in his ears. He can’t move his fingers. Nuka’s whole body is shaking, sweat pouring down his temples.\n\nPeterson rounds the table, stalking to Nuka. He strips the tape from Nuka’s lips, slow enough to peel skin. “Want to talk?” he taunts.\n\nNuka spits blood. His lips are torn, teeth glinting red. “Never,” he rasps.\n\nPeterson sighs, almost disappointed. He grabs Nuka’s smallest finger, pressing it flat against the table. A hammer drops—thud—on bone. Snapping, wet crunch. Nuka howls, back arching, body jerking like a ragdoll.\n\nGelbstein’s face grows cold, all warmth replaced by ice. Rage burns in his gut. “You touch him again, I’ll kill you,” Gelbstein says, voice pure venom.\n\nPeterson shrugs, hammer already swinging—crunch—another finger broken, the sound sharp, unreal. Nuka’s sobs are a jagged, broken thing. Tears streak his fucked-up face.\n\n“I’ll keep going,” Peterson says, “until you tell me.”\n\nGelbstein stares hard into Nuka’s eyes. He works his jaw. “Don’t say a fucking word,” he growls, voice breaking.\n\nPeterson shakes his head. He grabs Nuka’s arm, rolls up the sleeve, and presses a blade to the skin, slicing a shallow, mean path, blood oozing in bright lines. Nuka whimpers—a sound so raw it scrapes Gelbstein’s bones.\n\nPeterson laughs. “You boys are loyal. I’ll give you that.”\n\nHe moves to Gelbstein again. A knife—cold and sharp to the cheekbone, drawing a neat line. Gelbstein refuses to flinch.\n\n“We can do this all day,” Peterson says.\n\nGelbstein spits. “You won’t get shit.”\n\nPeterson drives the knife straight into Gelbstein’s thigh—right to the hilt. Hot pain lances up his spine—he can’t stop the guttural bellow that rips out of his throat. Blood streams down his leg, pooling on the floor.\n\nGelbstein’s heart is jackhammering, sweat pouring down his chest. He fights to stay conscious. If he blacks out now, Nuka’s fucking dead.\n\nNuka’s breathing is fucked, all shallow gasps. His gaze flickers, wild, terrified—there’s defiance left, but not much.\n\n“Kill me,” Gelbstein spits at Peterson, blood flecking his lips. “You can do what you want to me. I’ll never talk.”\n\nPeterson’s smile is hollow. “Fine.” He raises the hammer again, but pauses, eyeing Nuka. “Or maybe I just work on him until there’s nothing left.”\n\nNuka’s body sags, battered and burned out. But when he stares at Gelbstein—just for a split second—something fierce passes between them. A promise.\n\nPeterson brings the blade to Nuka’s other arm, sawing in slow, deliberate lines. Blood drips down to the floor, mixing with Gelbstein’s. The copper stench thickens, makes Gelbstein’s stomach turn.\n\n“This is your last chance. Coordinates, now. Or he dies.”\n\nGelbstein’s chest heaves—he spits, blood and bile. “Go fuck yourself.”\n\nPeterson laughs, swinging the hammer down—crunch, shatter—Nuka’s wrist breaks, an awful, meaty crack. Nuka’s scream rips through the room, both desperate and final. His head falls forward, breath coming in wet, hiccuping gasps. Blood from his lip drips onto the floor.\n\nGelbstein shouts, voice shredded with rage, “You fucking bastard! Kill me! Leave him alone!”\n\nPeterson moves behind Nuka, wrapping one hand around his head. He presses the knife to Nuka’s throat, cold steel dragging a thin line of blood. “I’ll do it.”\n\nGelbstein’s eyes go wide. He lunges, chair screeching, agony shooting through his body. He strains with every ounce of muscle left in his arms and legs, metal biting bone, red streak peeling down his wrists.\n\nPeterson grins, knife pricking skin. Nuka’s eyes find Gelbstein’s. His lips move—soundless, but clear, all desperate apology. Don’t.\n\nGelbstein’s voice breaks. “Don’t you dare!”\n\nPeterson’s hand tightens. The knife presses, cutting deeper.\n\nNuka’s eyes flutter. He doesn’t stop staring at Gelbstein.\n\nPeterson’s voice is low, final. “Say goodbye, Captain.”\n\nTime freezes—every muscle in Gelbstein’s body thrumming, every nerve burning. He screams himself hoarse, curses flying, useless fury. He can do nothing but watch as Peterson’s knife draws a bright, arterial line across Nuka’s throat. Blood gushes—fast, hot, pooling at Nuka’s collarbone. Nuka’s head lolls, blood burbling from his lips.\n\nGelbstein’s breath rattles. He roars, thrashing, vision blurring.\n\nPeterson drops the knife, cocky grin gone, face blank as he steps away. Gelbstein’s strength ebbs—all that’s left is red, burning hate and the hollow thud of Nuka’s dying gasps. The world narrows to that ragged, ugly sound.\n\nPeterson circles, head cocked. “Still not talking? Then you can die with him.”\n\nGelbstein spits blood, glaring. “You first.”\n\nHis vision darkens, breath shallow. He watches as Nuka’s life drains, slow and silent.\n\nHe goes under, the echo of Nuka’s dying eyes burned into his skull.","title":"","gen_started":"2025-06-03T04:38:41.186Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T04:39:16.877Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["Gelbstein’s neck snaps forward—his head pounds, jaw tight, pulse thrumming through his skull.

Metal rattles. Cold air hits. The world stinks of piss, sweat, and blood. Steel digs at wrists and ankles, locking flesh to the chair. Movement—rubber soles grinding over concrete, a sharp squeal. A cable slaps the table, trailing battery clamps. The light above swings, casting shadows that dart and shrink, teasing out the ugly, mean shapes of the room—a slab of stained flooring, a pockmarked wall. Someone breathes hard, close enough to taste their sour stench. Thick gloves slap cable metal against palm.\n\nThe table splits the space—tools lined up, ugly teeth glinting under the light. A blade scrapes the tray, a high metallic screech. A gloved hand wipes blood away, painting a brown swipe off steel. The battery hums—low, hungry.\n\nSomeone mutters in accented English. “You keep fucking quiet, Nuka.”\n\nA jaw pops. The back of the chair creaks. An arm tenses, veins bulging under skin but locked down hard. The tongue tastes grit, iron, a split lip stinging with every swallow. The room’s heat spikes and falls, the wet rag smell of spilled blood everywhere.\n\nA boot slams the concrete. The table rocks. The chair shudders as someone’s legs twist, digging heels into the ground for leverage. No give in the locks, only cold pinching harder at bone. The light flickers—buzzing.\n\n“You hear me? Don’t say shit. Not a fucking word.”\n\nBreath comes rough and wet beside him. The other chair strains under a body jerking hard—bones crack, a garbled scream trapped inside. A gloved hand fists hair and yanks back. A jaw cracks—snap. Saliva hits the floor, dark and sticky. Blood drips down a chin, thick and steady.\n\nA clamp snaps closed on a finger. The bone groans—strain—then a hammer arcs down. Crunch. A scream rips the air, echoing in the tiny room, bouncing off the stained walls. The clamps release, someone choking on a whimper, sucking back air like it’s the only relief in a mile of pain.\n\nThe interrogator’s breath is slow, methodical. The blade slides—shick—between fingers, dragging skin, leaving shallow red lines that bead up, fat and bright above the knuckles. Steel grinds against steel. A tongue licks cracked lips, jaw set.\n\n“Give it up. Coordinates, or I start taking pieces.”\n\nThe chair on the right jolts. A boot kicks at the slab of concrete, metal rings clatter, a howl bursting free. The interrogator sighs, lifts the car battery clamp, and jams it hard to an ankle. The jolt bites—stomach twisting, teeth slamming shut—before the current sizzles through flesh. The body lurches, muscles seizing, knocking the chair sideways with a screech. The scream tears out again, raw, shredded open.\n\n“You stubborn fuckers,” the interrogator grunts. “You got anything to say?”\n\nSilence. A spit hits the floor. Air huffs, chest rising and falling in ragged shivers. Saliva streaks a bloody trail down. The world narrows to the arc of a blade, the whine of the swinging light, the wet sounds of blood and spit, and the never-ending ache of metal digging in.\n\n“You wanna die for your secrets?” The interrogator leans close, hot breath in the ear. “You wanna eat shit for people who don’t give a fuck if you live or die?”\n\nA grip clamps the jaw, squeezing until teeth grind together. A thumb digs hard beneath the bone, popping a lip wide. Blood froths, sticky and bright. The interrogator jams two fingers into the mouth—shoves them deep, searching under the tongue—then rips them out, trailing a thick string of spit.\n\n“You got nothin’ but pain left coming.”\n\nA boot slams down. The chair jolts again. A hammer falls, another finger shatters. Crunch. Howling—noisy, sharp, and short, forced into a gurgling whimper as breathing goes rough.\n\nA blade taps the side of the face—tap, tap, tap—before scoring a shallow trench across the cheek, blood welling up in a hot line. The edge of the knife glimmers wet. A fist shakes the jaw again, then shoves the head back.\n\nA clamp snaps against earlobe flesh. The trigger goes again—zzt—singeing a patch raw. The scream this time isn’t even human, just a stretched, broken sound that slices right down the spine. Boots crunch steps along the concrete, pacing—always circling, always closing in.\n\nTools clatter together—pliers, hammers, wrenches. A hand grabs the jaw, yanking the head up.\n\n“Talk or I fuck up your eyes next. You think you’re tough? I can make you beg.”\n\nThe body tightens in the chair, every muscle shaking, breaths coming short and hard. The tongue presses against the roof of the mouth, trying to keep from biting it through. Snot and blood drip steady, pooling on the floor.\n\nA fist slams the table. The interrogator’s voice is low, grating. “You’re gonna break. You’ll both fucking break.”\n\nA gloved hand wraps around a wrist, fingers probing the break already made. It squeezes. Bones grind, a shriek slicing the air. The other hand swipes the table clean, all tools scattered, bouncing loudly.\n\nThe clamp finds a nipple, twisting it, pinching to purple. The body jerks, yanking at the bindings. The interrogator grins, twisting harder, pulling the sore skin until it splits. Blood beads, sweat soaks the shirt.\n\nThe other man—broken, breathing heavy, head lolling. The tongue flicks in a mouth full of blood. The interrogator slaps him across the face—snap. The room echoes with curses spat between gasps, spit flying.\n\nThe interrogator moves to the battery again, clamps both ears. The hum spikes, a jolt cutting through skull, eyes rolling back in the sockets. Watery shit leaks down the cheek, heat rising under the skin, head lolling, drool slipping down the shirt.\n\nThe light swings again, streaks bending. The body on the right is trembling, jaw set, muttering something—soft curses, useless prayers, the edge of a song. The anthem. The words drift out on shuddering breaths.\n\n“Tear down—the desert sand—in the—name of—motherland...”\n\nA blow silences him. Whack. The mouth splits wider, a tooth chips, blood splattering the interrogator’s knuckles.\n\nThe room shrinks again—all sound, all pain, all boiling hate. The interrogator’s voice is a drone.\n\n“You done yet? Wanna die screaming, or you wanna make it easy?”\n\nA heel digs at the floor. Metal grinds. A hand flexes at the ankle, searching for anything—anything. The interrogator doesn’t notice—he’s busy, wrenching the other chair around, tipping it to one side, fingers prying at broken joints.\n\n“You don’t look so hot, Nuka.” There’s a sneering tone, a sick pleasure. Clamp snaps. The skin pops; a howl ricochets.\n\nA hand closes on the hidden switch at the boot. Digits fumble, nerves shot, all pain. The interrogator doesn’t see the movement, too caught up in the next threat, knife rising, blood dripping. The light swings one last time, then everything drowns in red.\n\nThunk. A blade finds flesh—deep, crunching, the last blow. The body slumps, jerks—one, two, three times. Blood sprays wide, spattering the floor, painting the slabs.\n\nA foot hammers down, muscles bunching, heel grinding into the boot sole until the switch under the arch pops.\n\nClick.\n\nThe world snaps—everything shudders, freezes mid-movement. The stink of blood goes sharp, then gone. Sound shrinks away, replaced by a ringing silence, thick as tar. The cold concrete, the stinging steel, the shadow-leaping light—gone. There’s a giant, hungry ache in the gut, twisting like nausea, then nothing.\n\n—\n\nA cot creaks. Canvas shifts under shifting weight. The air is different here—dust, gun oil, washed-out sun cutting through slats, no stink of blood. A chorus of boots thump outside. A clock rattles, hands dragging toward 0500. The barracks hums with breathing, soft curses, bodies rolling in sleep.\n\nGelbstein’s eyes shoot open. His jaw aches. He blinks, limbs unsteady. Sweat drips cold under his shirt. He listens—someone breathing next to him. The world is smaller, cleaner, sun not yet up. It’s the start. Again.\n\nA chair whines across the floor. Someone stands, shadow tall at the edge of the cot. The shape is familiar—right height, right build, that fucking posture. Gelbstein wipes his mouth, the metallic taste gone.\n\nThe shadow says nothing. The silence buzzes. Gelbstein’s hands ball into fists, heart pounding.\n\n“Get your ass up. Training’s in ten.”\n\nThe cot frame groans as he swings his legs down. A sharp jolt in his thigh—phantom pain, quickly fading. He glances over, catching the other man’s eye. There’s nothing in the look but a grim sort of focus. No memory, no pain.\n\nGelbstein spits to the side, tasting only spit.\n\nHe stands, boots hitting the floor with a thud. The world smells of gun oil and old sweat, the air cut thin by the distant clatter of arms. He rolls his shoulders, shaking off the ghost of pain, fighting the memory that isn’t really his.\n\n“Armory in five, Private. Don’t make me repeat myself.”\n\nThe door whines open and light floods the barracks—brand new, empty of death. But Gelbstein’s gut tells him some things don’t stay buried. Not here. Not with him staring at the man who, for a second, he’d watched fucking die.\n\nHe shoves the thought away. Orders bark outside. Time to start again.","title":"","swipe_id":2,"swipes":["<cont>\n\nA plastic click echoes as the room falls into motionless, hostile silence. There’s nothing left that isn’t blood and the stink of burnt metal. The chains biting into Gelbstein’s limbs ache every time he shifts even a fraction. He can’t feel his leg right anymore—just a warm, sticky throb telling him the knife is still there, the wound pulsing in time with every heartbeat that’s left. Cold sweat collects along his jaw.\n\nNuka is a broken, slumped mess. His breathing stops and starts in short, frantic bursts—quick, wet noises in his chest that get thinner with every passing second. The skin under his jaw is split open, trickling blood that pools on his collar and down the slope of his chest. On the floor, sticky puddles merge. Each time Nuka’s body moves, his boots scrape concrete, jittering out a pathetic thump.\n\nThe air in the room grows thick with the stink of copper and adrenaline. The light above swings again, casting hard lines over every surface—exposing the tremor in Gelbstein’s shoulders, the little twitches in Nuka’s hands as he tries, desperately, to clutch at the wound that’s killing him.\n\nGelbstein’s voice shreds out, just a rag of sound left. “Stop fucking looking at him,” he spits at the bastard still grinning by the door. The response is another heavy, deliberate thud from Peterson’s boots as he leans back against the wall. There’s no interest left in the man, no satisfaction. Just a blank caution—he’s waiting to see if there’s any more fight left.\n\nA chunk of blood-laced sputum hits the floor. Gelbstein’s wrists burn as he slides his arm in the metal restraint, scraping skin raw. The trickle of blood between his knuckles is the only proof that he’s still here, that his body hasn’t given out entirely. His good foot digs to the floor, bracing. Just one fucking chance—if the bastard gives him one second.\n\nNuka’s eyes flicker toward Gelbstein, not really seeing. There’s pain in that look—something desperate. A plea and an apology. His lips are shredded, too torn up to form words now. His right hand shakes, fingers bent and broken in unnatural directions, the wrist swollen and purple-black. The other arm is covered in shallow, straight cuts that keep welling up thin ribbons of blood. The pain has gutted him inside.\n\n“You’re going to let him die like that?” Gelbstein’s tone is acid, spit thick in his mouth. “Just got bored, did you?”\n\nNo answer. Peterson’s silhouette blots out the swinging light.\n\nThe battery cables are dropped, tools landing with a hollow clang, and it’s clear—Peterson’s done here. Whatever information he wanted is gone; maybe he never wanted it, maybe he just wanted to play, see how many pieces he could break the pair into before something important split. There’s no more torture—just an ending.\n\nGelbstein tries to focus, picking desperately through the fog that’s settled in his skull. Nuka’s boot. The device. Through the haze of agony, he forces his half-numb hand downward, fumbling in tiny, useless jerks. The world shrinks to his pulse, the lines of the chains, the faint whimper in Nuka’s throat.\n\nNuka slumps, body finally letting go. The ragged, awful sound in his throat rattles out—then stops. His head falls forward, jaw slack, blood pooling into the hollow at the base of his throat. He’s gone. Whatever spotlight of his will that kept him up, that made his eyes stay open through the pain: extinguished.\n\nGelbstein jerks his good foot up, smashing his boot heel against the frame of his chair, trying to break the straps. He grits his teeth, gasping from the effort. “Come on, come on, you useless piece of shit,” he mutters, voice hoarse and flat.\n\nThe pain in his thigh is sharp, almost overwhelming. Every twitch sets off a fresh wave of agony. Blood has drenched his whole leg, sock squelching with it. It’s only getting worse—he can feel the world going thin at the edges, a tunnel closing in.\n\nHe knows he’s about to pass out. He knows Peterson will come back, or maybe just leave the two of them to rot here. No one from Falkos is coming. He’s the only fucking chance left.\n\nGelbstein’s hand finally finds the edge of Nuka’s boot. His fingers scrape clumsily along the sole, searching for any edge, any break in the material. There’s nothing at first—just blood and torn laces and the throb of his own panic—but then, with a jolt, his thumb hits an odd metal bump. He presses, feeling the tip of a small switch gouge his skin.\n\nHis world spins as something metal slides free. The device is rough, rectangle-shaped, covered in blood now, but it fits right in his palm. He hears his own breathing, ragged and loud, and the wet scrape of his boot against the ground as he drags his leg closer.\n\nGelbstein lifts the device, pressing it to his chest—he has to die to make this work.\n\nHe breathes in hard, the room tight, and shifts his thigh—shoving the knife in deeper, feeling it grind against bone. He almost blacks out from the pain, but forces his thumb onto the blood-slicked button near the top of the device. He jams down, teeth clenched so hard they could shatter.\n\nA loud click, a rush of heat and wrongness, rips through his body. He knows this isn’t going to mean anything—he’s dying, Nuka’s already dead, and the bastard won’t remember—but the last thing he does is stare at the broken lines of Nuka’s body, burns the image in, then squeezes the trigger until everything erupts in noise.\n\nThe sound is like a metal gate slamming. Static crackles through the air. Gelbstein’s heart stops. His vision tunnels. The chair tilts as the world rips sideways, tugging him out of the moment and into oblivion—blood, chains, and pain all sucked away in an instant.\n\nJust before it all goes black, he mouths two words to Nuka, words the man will never remember:\n\n“Not your fault.”\n\nAnd then there’s nothing left.\n\n—\n\nA sharp slap of boots on linoleum, a cold wash of air, the metallic taste of old water in the pipes.\n\nNuka opens his eyes. He’s on a military cot—his body is whole, his hands are fine. The blood is gone, his uniform crisp and new. The scent of the barracks, sweat, and soap and stiff sheets, presses in like a memory.\n\nThe dawn outside is grey and cool—there’s a racket somewhere further in the tent, men grumbling about morning drills. It’s his first day at Falkos. The same way it always has been. And he remembers every scream, every broken finger, every second that Gelbstein bled out buying him time.\n\nHe drags a hand down his face, shuddering, pressing his palm flat against the smooth, unscarred skin at his throat. He knows the pain will come again. He knows the reset always brings him back here. He stares across the empty row, waiting for Gelbstein to walk through that tent—clean, alive, with no idea what had happened.\n\nNuka’s voice is a patchwork of fury and grief, low and thin:\n\n“Fucking hell. We start again.”","<cont>\n\n\"Open your eyes. Don’t—fuck, Nuka, don’t—bastard, look at me. You piece of shit—Peterson, you stay right the fuck there—\"\n\nMetal creaks. The plastic chair rocks, slowed by the pooling mess—blood everywhere, Nuka’s boots knocked off, one leg spasming, sneakers half torn. Gelbstein’s chest hammers uselessly against the restraints, hot ache in his arms. Hands turned slick from sweat, rope digging in deeper. The pain in his leg has gone numb. He can’t feel his toes. Everything inside thrums.\n\nNuka sags against the wood. Spit hangs off his chin. The cut across his throat leaks in bright pulses. He’s limp, but the body still twitches. A choking sound gurgles out—air and blood mixing, froth coating the gag and corners of his mouth.\n\nGelbstein spits. He tastes copper and bile. The restraints rattle, metal scraping the table.\n\n\"Why the fuck did you do that, you dumb fuck? You couldn’t just—you couldn’t keep your mouth shut?\"\n\nSweat drips down the side of his face, stinging the new cut on his cheek. The blade’s edge is still sharp in his memory. He breathes, but it’s shallow. Soap and copper. Staleness. The taste of something burnt, as if the battery’s discharge still lingers in the air.\n\nHis eyes flick to Nuka's chest. It doesn't rise. The noise of the bulb overhead is louder now—a jittery zzzzt, swinging back and forth, shadow scrawling across busted tile. The stink of iron and piss fills the room. Every minute is longer than the last.\n\nLow humming—Gelbstein grinds his teeth again, jaw muscle popping. The pain in his mouth radiates up to his temples. He watches Peterson step away, boots splashing in the mess on the floor. Satisfying, in a way. At least the fucker isn't smiling anymore.\n\n\"You think this gets you what you want? Huh? You think you’re some fucking genius?\"\n\nNo answer. Peterson grabs the pliers—the ones with Nuka’s teeth stuck between the jaws. Click, clack, click, clack. He sets them down. He’s breathing through his mouth now, like the stink bothers him.\n\nGelbstein lets out a rough laugh. \"Not feeling so keen, are you? Won’t find another like him. Soft head, hard heart. Fucking idiot hero. Never got the hang of shutting up.\"\n\nHis throat aches. He’s thirsty. He wants to drown in something other than spit and blood. He wants to stab Peterson in the ear, right through, clean and simple.\n\nHe shifts in the chair, rough against the bindings. His foot snags something solid near the base—a lump, under sole, unfamiliar. Nuka’s boot, kicked off in the struggle. There’s a weight in it, hard and boxy. Gelbstein’s chest tightens.\n\nHe jerks his knee, grits his teeth. Muscle tears, something inside gives. He kicks out and the chair bounces. Peterson spins, gun out, furious.\n\n\"You want to die, you fucking animal? You want to die like he did?\"\n\nGelbstein laughs again. \"No one dies like he does. Trust me.\"\n\nHe shoves backwards. The boot edge catches the leg of the chair. There’s a snap—something breaks. Pain floods his thigh, rushing hot and blinding.\n\nHe puts weight on the wound, grinds the metal into the gash. The agony gives him a wild clarity, everything sharp and ugly. He feels the device pressing against the cut—cold, slick, smeared with blood and nerves.\n\n\"Fuck—just—\" he growls, words lost in spittle. \"Let’s see, Nuka, what the hell you’ve got in there.\"\n\nHe crunches down, muscle flexing, bodies squirming. He hears Peterson coming, footsteps slapping wet on the floor.\n\nHe gets a toe on the device. He finds the button. He jams it—hard, so the little blade in the mechanism bites right into the exposed, open, raw muscle of his calf.\n\nThere’s a sting like hot acid. His mind blanks. The ritual is done. It needs more blood—he’s got enough.\n\n\"Fuck,\" he breathes. Head rolling back, mouth salt and agony. \"End of the line, huh? Son of a bitch—\"\n\nHe feels the tear—the last rip, the nerve giving out. Pressure in his thigh. Blood. Bones grinding.\n\nThe light swings. The room flickers and pulses, the humming turning into a sharp, rising whine. White dots swarm his eyes.\n\nHe stares at Nuka’s dead face—slack, empty, dark. He tries for a chuckle, comes out a wet cough. \"You fucking idiot,\" he croaks. \"You’re supposed to watch my back, moron.\"\n\nHis hands fall open. He goes limp, body sagging against the restraints. The heat in his leg dulls, then vanishes.\n\nHe hears the time loop’s click.\n\nGelbstein’s mind is torn open, memory shredded. Faces blur. The world’s noise collapses. Blood washes out the color of the scene.\n\nThere’s a snap.\n\n—\n\nSheets—rough, canvas, greasy with old sweat and antiseptic. The whirring of vents. Light—thin, not swinging. The rasp of boots on polished floors.\n\nGelbstein’s head aches. He’s upright. He blinks, squinting at the thin slide of morning sun.\n\nThere’s a body on the lower bunk. Mess of clothes, gear bag, boots. Someone fumbling, breath hitching through teeth.\n\nHe swings his legs to the side. His calf burns, then doesn’t. The pain is gone. No blood, no mess. Just the clack of boots hitting tile.\n\n\"Get your ass up,\" Gelbstein snaps, voice still thick from sleep and raw from memory. \"We’ve got thirty minutes before drill.\"\n\nThe man on the low bunk grunts. There’s a pause—uncomfortable. A dragged moment, tight with something sour and nervous.\n\nHe watches Nuka drag himself upright, hands shaking, mouth tight. There’s a flash of pain in the eyes—something that doesn’t belong, something from before, or after, or between.\n\nGelbstein scowls. The bastard looks like he hasn’t slept for weeks. Palms twitching, face dull and waxy. Still, the stupid idiot is up, getting dressed, boots tight, jacket over the old scars.\n\n\"Don’t forget your dog tags,\" Gelbstein grumbles, tossing the chain onto the lower bed. \"Left them on the sink again, idiot.\"\n\nNuka flinches, catching them mid-air. There’s a moment where the chain slips, the metal scraping against battered knuckles.\n\nGelbstein shakes his head. \"You’re gonna get yourself killed one day. For real.\"\n\nHe stands, cracks his spine, stretches the ache from his neck. The echo of pain still lingers, phantom, like a memory that refuses to fade. There’s heaviness in his gut, a sourness at the edges of his mind.\n\nHe keeps his tone hard. \"We’ve got a full gear check in ten. Move it.\"\n\nNuka’s voice is hoarse—too hoarse. \"Yes, Sir.\"\n\nGelbstein watches him, jaw set. There’s something in the way the idiot looks at him. He doesn’t like it.\n\nHe grabs his own vest. The weight is familiar, comforting. He glances at Nuka again, eyes narrowed.\n\n\"Don’t slow me down,\" he mutters.\n\nThe rest is just sweat, boots, and the echo of a memory that no longer exists. The air smells like metal and stale breath, no blood.\n\nHe doesn’t remember anything more than that.\n\nBut there’s a weight in his chest that refuses to go away.","<cont>\n\nA door bangs open. Metal rattles. Cold air hits. The world stinks of piss, sweat, and blood. Steel digs at wrists and ankles, locking flesh to the chair. Movement—rubber soles grinding over concrete, a sharp squeal. A cable slaps the table, trailing battery clamps. The light above swings, casting shadows that dart and shrink, teasing out the ugly, mean shapes of the room—a slab of stained flooring, a pockmarked wall. Someone breathes hard, close enough to taste their sour stench. Thick gloves slap cable metal against palm.\n\nThe table splits the space—tools lined up, ugly teeth glinting under the light. A blade scrapes the tray, a high metallic screech. A gloved hand wipes blood away, painting a brown swipe off steel. The battery hums—low, hungry.\n\nSomeone mutters in accented English. “You keep fucking quiet, Nuka.”\n\nA jaw pops. The back of the chair creaks. An arm tenses, veins bulging under skin but locked down hard. The tongue tastes grit, iron, a split lip stinging with every swallow. The room’s heat spikes and falls, the wet rag smell of spilled blood everywhere.\n\nA boot slams the concrete. The table rocks. The chair shudders as someone’s legs twist, digging heels into the ground for leverage. No give in the locks, only cold pinching harder at bone. The light flickers—buzzing.\n\n“You hear me? Don’t say shit. Not a fucking word.”\n\nBreath comes rough and wet beside him. The other chair strains under a body jerking hard—bones crack, a garbled scream trapped inside. A gloved hand fists hair and yanks back. A jaw cracks—snap. Saliva hits the floor, dark and sticky. Blood drips down a chin, thick and steady.\n\nA clamp snaps closed on a finger. The bone groans—strain—then a hammer arcs down. Crunch. A scream rips the air, echoing in the tiny room, bouncing off the stained walls. The clamps release, someone choking on a whimper, sucking back air like it’s the only relief in a mile of pain.\n\nThe interrogator’s breath is slow, methodical. The blade slides—shick—between fingers, dragging skin, leaving shallow red lines that bead up, fat and bright above the knuckles. Steel grinds against steel. A tongue licks cracked lips, jaw set.\n\n“Give it up. Coordinates, or I start taking pieces.”\n\nThe chair on the right jolts. A boot kicks at the slab of concrete, metal rings clatter, a howl bursting free. The interrogator sighs, lifts the car battery clamp, and jams it hard to an ankle. The jolt bites—stomach twisting, teeth slamming shut—before the current sizzles through flesh. The body lurches, muscles seizing, knocking the chair sideways with a screech. The scream tears out again, raw, shredded open.\n\n“You stubborn fuckers,” the interrogator grunts. “You got anything to say?”\n\nSilence. A spit hits the floor. Air huffs, chest rising and falling in ragged shivers. Saliva streaks a bloody trail down. The world narrows to the arc of a blade, the whine of the swinging light, the wet sounds of blood and spit, and the never-ending ache of metal digging in.\n\n“You wanna die for your secrets?” The interrogator leans close, hot breath in the ear. “You wanna eat shit for people who don’t give a fuck if you live or die?”\n\nA grip clamps the jaw, squeezing until teeth grind together. A thumb digs hard beneath the bone, popping a lip wide. Blood froths, sticky and bright. The interrogator jams two fingers into the mouth—shoves them deep, searching under the tongue—then rips them out, trailing a thick string of spit.\n\n“You got nothin’ but pain left coming.”\n\nA boot slams down. The chair jolts again. A hammer falls, another finger shatters. Crunch. Howling—noisy, sharp, and short, forced into a gurgling whimper as breathing goes rough.\n\nA blade taps the side of the face—tap, tap, tap—before scoring a shallow trench across the cheek, blood welling up in a hot line. The edge of the knife glimmers wet. A fist shakes the jaw again, then shoves the head back.\n\nA clamp snaps against earlobe flesh. The trigger goes again—zzt—singeing a patch raw. The scream this time isn’t even human, just a stretched, broken sound that slices right down the spine. Boots crunch steps along the concrete, pacing—always circling, always closing in.\n\nTools clatter together—pliers, hammers, wrenches. A hand grabs the jaw, yanking the head up.\n\n“Talk or I fuck up your eyes next. You think you’re tough? I can make you beg.”\n\nThe body tightens in the chair, every muscle shaking, breaths coming short and hard. The tongue presses against the roof of the mouth, trying to keep from biting it through. Snot and blood drip steady, pooling on the floor.\n\nA fist slams the table. The interrogator’s voice is low, grating. “You’re gonna break. You’ll both fucking break.”\n\nA gloved hand wraps around a wrist, fingers probing the break already made. It squeezes. Bones grind, a shriek slicing the air. The other hand swipes the table clean, all tools scattered, bouncing loudly.\n\nThe clamp finds a nipple, twisting it, pinching to purple. The body jerks, yanking at the bindings. The interrogator grins, twisting harder, pulling the sore skin until it splits. Blood beads, sweat soaks the shirt.\n\nThe other man—broken, breathing heavy, head lolling. The tongue flicks in a mouth full of blood. The interrogator slaps him across the face—snap. The room echoes with curses spat between gasps, spit flying.\n\nThe interrogator moves to the battery again, clamps both ears. The hum spikes, a jolt cutting through skull, eyes rolling back in the sockets. Watery shit leaks down the cheek, heat rising under the skin, head lolling, drool slipping down the shirt.\n\nThe light swings again, streaks bending. The body on the right is trembling, jaw set, muttering something—soft curses, useless prayers, the edge of a song. The anthem. The words drift out on shuddering breaths.\n\n“Tear down—the desert sand—in the—name of—motherland...”\n\nA blow silences him. Whack. The mouth splits wider, a tooth chips, blood splattering the interrogator’s knuckles.\n\nThe room shrinks again—all sound, all pain, all boiling hate. The interrogator’s voice is a drone.\n\n“You done yet? Wanna die screaming, or you wanna make it easy?”\n\nA heel digs at the floor. Metal grinds. A hand flexes at the ankle, searching for anything—anything. The interrogator doesn’t notice—he’s busy, wrenching the other chair around, tipping it to one side, fingers prying at broken joints.\n\n“You don’t look so hot, Nuka.” There’s a sneering tone, a sick pleasure. Clamp snaps. The skin pops; a howl ricochets.\n\nA hand closes on the hidden switch at the boot. Digits fumble, nerves shot, all pain. The interrogator doesn’t see the movement, too caught up in the next threat, knife rising, blood dripping. The light swings one last time, then everything drowns in red.\n\nThunk. A blade finds flesh—deep, crunching, the last blow. The body slumps, jerks—one, two, three times. Blood sprays wide, spattering the floor, painting the slabs.\n\nA foot hammers down, muscles bunching, heel grinding into the boot sole until the switch under the arch pops.\n\nClick.\n\nThe world snaps—everything shudders, freezes mid-movement. The stink of blood goes sharp, then gone. Sound shrinks away, replaced by a ringing silence, thick as tar. The cold concrete, the stinging steel, the shadow-leaping light—gone. There’s a giant, hungry ache in the gut, twisting like nausea, then nothing.\n\n—\n\nA cot creaks. Canvas shifts under shifting weight. The air is different here—dust, gun oil, washed-out sun cutting through slats, no stink of blood. A chorus of boots thump outside. A clock rattles, hands dragging toward 0500. The barracks hums with breathing, soft curses, bodies rolling in sleep.\n\nGelbstein’s eyes shoot open. His jaw aches. He blinks, limbs unsteady. Sweat drips cold under his shirt. He listens—someone breathing next to him. The world is smaller, cleaner, sun not yet up. It’s the start. Again.\n\nA chair whines across the floor. Someone stands, shadow tall at the edge of the cot. The shape is familiar—right height, right build, that fucking posture. Gelbstein wipes his mouth, the metallic taste gone.\n\nThe shadow says nothing. The silence buzzes. Gelbstein’s hands ball into fists, heart pounding.\n\n“Get your ass up. Training’s in ten.”\n\nThe cot frame groans as he swings his legs down. A sharp jolt in his thigh—phantom pain, quickly fading. He glances over, catching the other man’s eye. There’s nothing in the look but a grim sort of focus.

Don’t make me repeat myself.”\n\nThe door whines open and light floods the barracks—brand new, empty of death. But Gelbstein’s gut tells him some things don’t stay buried. Not here.

The table legs scrape. The light swings. Gelbstein’s heartbeat pounds in his ears louder than all the sounds in this goddamn place—except Nuka’s breathing. The sound is getting thinner, hiccuping in his chest.\n\nFootsteps click. Peterson’s knife clatters onto the steel tray. Nuka’s head sags, thick strings of spit and blood soaking what’s left of his shirt. The tension is a choking hand locked around Gelbstein’s throat, squeezing until there’s nothing left but fire.\n\n“Look at him, Captain,” Peterson says, low, just above the racket in Gelbstein’s skull. “Barely fucking breathing. Smashed his hand to pulp, what’d it get you?”\n\nGelbstein tries to roll his shoulder, tries to snarl back, but his body has already emptied itself out: sweat, saliva, blood streaming through every cut. He can barely get one word out.\n\n“Untie me,” he spits, breath punched short by pain. “Do it yourself, coward.”\n\nPeterson’s teeth show. He steps closer, squats, wrapping his knuckles on the side of Gelbstein’s boot—right where the time loop device is hidden. He digs his thumb in. Bone creaks.\n\n“Always the hero. But heroes die the slow way here, Captain. Watch closely.”\n\nPeterson grabs Nuka by the shoulder, jerking him upright. The wet slap of Nuka’s back against the chair is an ugly crackle. Nuka’s face is fucked, swollen, lips shredded. The blood is everywhere now—slicking his jawline, pooling under his chair. The light swings, crosses the stains.\n\n“You know what the problem with loyalty is, Captain?” Peterson says. “Nobody returns it. Not your bosses, not your country. Not even this little fucker you keep trying to protect.” He jams the butt of the knife between Nuka’s ribs, slow and purposeful. An ugly thump. Nuka gasps. That sound—choked, animal—sinks into Gelbstein’s marrow.\n\nGelbstein’s arms strain against the cuffs again, wrists tearing open and stinging down to bone. The sharpness of it almost helps him focus. He glares through Peterson, holding every ounce of hatred.\n\nPeterson leans in, voice soft. “He’s almost out. Maybe that’s for the best. You want to save him? Give me something.”\n\nThere’s a flicker—Nuka’s head lolling, mouth moving, breath catching on something that might be a name. Not just any sound, either. Not some empty plea. Gelbstein—hears it clear. His name, broken and ragged, caught in a dying man’s mouth.\n\nGelbstein’s guts twist. There’s nothing left in him but poison and rage. “Try harder, you fucking prick,” he hisses.\n\nPeterson’s mouth twists up. He presses two fingers just under Nuka’s jaw, feeling for a pulse. “You hear that, Captain? Your dog’s got nothing left.” Fingers tap—tap—against Nuka’s limp arm. Pulse weak, fading. “He’s almost gone. You want him to wake up again, or should I finish him for you?”\n\nA tremor passes down Gelbstein’s arms. He grinds his teeth until enamel flakes. “You’re not killing him. If you do, I’ll find you wherever you run—”\n\nPeterson snorts. “You can’t run. You can’t crawl. You’re fucking tied up, Captain. You’re just another broken puppet in my room. Only difference is, you’re a little slower to break than your friend here.”\n\nHe pivots, grabs the pliers, and locks them on what’s left of Nuka’s index finger. There’s a pop, a wet, sticky crunch—Nuka’s head jerks back, mouth opening. Blood dribbles down his chin. The sound is a wet rattle.\n\n“You see that?” Peterson says. “I bet you heard it, Nuka. That’s your fucking hero, watching you bleed for him.” Another squeeze. Crack. The scream sounds like it’s coming from underwater, a gurgle, a pained whimper that just keeps going.\n\nGelbstein’s mouth curls into a snarl. “Let him go and I’ll tell you where the drop is. Coordinates—Kantar, east, under the old tramlines. That’s all you’re getting, fucker.”\n\nPeterson’s eyes narrow. “You’re lying.”\n\nGelbstein spits blood. “What the fuck else do you want? We’re both dead anyway.”\n\nPeterson shakes his head. He stomps on Gelbstein’s thigh—knife wound splitting wider. The chair jumps, slamming his head against the post. Dull thud. Gelbstein’s vision warps.\n\nSilence. Peterson stands over Nuka, lifts his chin, and studies him. “You want to say goodbye, Captain?”\n\nGelbstein’s voice is just a rasp. “You touch him again, I’ll cut your fucking throat open with your own knife.”\n\nPeterson grins. “Maybe next time.” He yanks the tape off Nuka’s busted mouth. “Hey. You got a last word for your Captain?”\n\nThe only thing that comes out is a strangled gasp, a breath drawn in around mangled teeth and ruined lips. Something about the shape of that sound stabs up under Gelbstein’s ribs. It’s not even a word—just hope, dying messily in a busted-up throat.\n\nPeterson shrugs. “Suit yourself.”\n\nHe slips the knife behind Nuka’s ear, presses down slow, carving a shallow red groove. Blood beads, streams down, tiny rivers meeting the pool already staining the concrete. The light groans on its chain. Gelbstein stares, chest heaving, every part of him screaming to break free, rip Peterson’s fucking eyes out with his bare hands.\n\nBut the skin is on fire. His vision is flickering at the corners, black creeping in. The knife in his own thigh pulses like a heartbeat. Pain—blinding, unending. The cuffs bite deeper as he scrapes his boots uselessly on the floor.\n\nPeterson stands, straightening his vest. “I’ll get that information. Whether you’re alive to see it doesn’t matter.” He circles, comes up behind Gelbstein, and grabs his hair—wrenches his head back. “You want me to start with your tongue or your fucking eyes?”\n\nGelbstein’s grin is all blood. “Either way, you’ll never forget my face.”\n\nPeterson’s hand claps over Gelbstein’s mouth, pinching his jaw so tight his teeth grind. The knife flashes—cold, sharp, under the chin. He’s carving just for the pleasure of it now, not even after anything. Blood drips onto Gelbstein’s vest, down his bare chest, slides over every old scar.\n\nWith one last kick, Peterson stomps the back of Gelbstein’s chair. The wood splinters, the metal groans. The whole room shakes. Light swings in a wild arc, shadows banding across blood, sweat, and shaking bodies.\n\nGelbstein’s breathing gets shallow, thready. Peterson steps away, cursing under his breath. A boot collides with the side of Nuka’s chair—thump. He lists, neck hanging at an awkward angle, eyes rolling.\n\nThere’s a lull. Gelbstein can feel something changing—slack in the cuffs, perhaps, or just exhaustion. He shifts his right leg back, angling his boot to the floor, heel to concrete. Feels the bulge pressing where Nuka slipped the loop device before. All he needs is one kick. One tap.\n\nPeterson’s footsteps recede. “Think about it while you bleed out. Be back in five. Maybe I’ll have your team in here to watch next time.”\n\nThe door slams. Heavy lock. The echo is endless.\n\nSweat pools at Gelbstein’s temples. The pain in his thigh is a wall now, cold and wet, blood pouring down to his boots. He can’t see properly—room is spinning—but all he can hear is Nuka’s ragged breathing, that one last gasp, his name nearly torn apart in the mess.\n\nHe shifts his weight, foot searching for the right angle, desperate, careful not to make too much noise. The device clicks, the tiniest pressure. The second button unlocks, the blood from his wound soaking down to the metal. The flash is instant—soundless, blinding.\n\nThe world stutters. There’s no pain, no sound, no blood, no cuffs. The shitty, buzzing light disappears. Every memory, every scream, every broken promise is gone—except for the part that matters: Nuka’s voice, catching his name at the edge of death.\n\nHe wakes up again to the sound of birds in the barracks yard, six hours before dawn, rifle still cool in his grip, Nuka five bunks down and breathing, breathing, breathing. No one else remembers. No one but him.\n\nAnd the first thing he does—before his heart can stop pounding, before hope can sag back down his spine—is roll over and stare into the dark, chewing his tongue, swearing on everything he has left that next time, whatever the cost, he’ll keep Nuka alive.","title":"","gen_started":"2025-06-03T05:14:04.299Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-03T05:15:17.462Z","swipe_id":0,"swipes":["<cont>\n\nThe room vibrates with a slow, grinding hum.

There’s a weird weightlessness; the pain he just felt in that warehouse—gone. Nuka slumps beside him, disoriented, shirt sticking to his skin, blood nowhere to be seen. Everything’s too… quiet. There’s a table, a row of microphones, and a guy with fuckin’… cat ears?\n\nGelbstein sits forward, stares, then checks his boot for the time loop device. Gone.
