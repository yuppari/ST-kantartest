Consciousness returned like a slow, painful tide. The air was thick with the smell of rust and damp concrete. Cold metal dug into his wrists and ankles, securing him to a chair. He tested the restraints; they were tight, unforgiving.\n\nA single, bare bulb swung lazily overhead, casting long, dancing shadows across the room. In the flickering light, he saw another figure slumped in a chair opposite him. Nuka. His head was bowed, but Gelbstein could see the slow rise and fall of his chest. He was alive. For now.\n\nThe heavy clank of a steel door being unbarred echoed in the small space. Footsteps approached—confident, familiar. A figure emerged from the oppressive darkness, stopping right in the middle of the room. Peterson. The fucking traitor stood there, no longer in a Falkos uniform, looking down at them as if they were insects.\n\"Captain. Private,\" Peterson said, his voice devoid of any warmth it once held. \"Glad you could join us.\"\n\n\"Peterson,\" Gelbstein growled, the name tasting like bile in his mouth. \"When I get out of this chair, I am going to rip your fucking spine out.\" He pulled against the locks, the metal scraping against his skin. This was useless.\n\nPeterson let out a short, humorless laugh. He gestured to a pair of silent Bhiya operatives flanking him. \"There will be none of that. I need information. Falkos mission coordinates for the last quarter. Everything.\" He stared at Gelbstein, his gaze cold. \"You cooperate, maybe I let the little one live.\"\n\nHe saw Nuka stir, lifting his head. There was a fresh gash on his cheek, but his eyes were defiant. \"Go fuck your mother,\" Nuka spat, his voice hoarse.\n\nPeterson's expression didn't change. He simply nodded to one of the goons. The man moved toward Nuka, pulling a pair of pliers from his belt. Gelbstein's blood ran cold.\n\"No. You deal with me, you piece of shit,\" Gelbstein yelled, trying to draw their attention. \"Leave him out of it!\"\n\nThe operative grabbed Nuka’s left hand, forcing it flat against the armrest of the chair. Nuka struggled, but he was bound too tightly.\n\"The coordinates, Captain,\" Peterson repeated calmly, as if discussing the weather. \"Give them to me, and this stops.\"\n\n\"Fuck you,\" Gelbstein bit out, his eyes locked on the glint of the pliers. He watched, helpless, as the tool was positioned over Nuka's index finger.\nA sickening *crunch* of bone and flesh followed, tearing a strangled scream from Nuka’s throat. It was a raw, agonizing sound that cut straight through Gelbstein. He thrashed in his chair, a guttural roar of fury escaping him. \"I'M GOING TO FUCKING KILL YOU!\"\n\nPeterson ignored him, his focus unwavering. \"The next finger, Captain. Or we could try a kneecap. I'm not a picky man.\"\nNuka was panting, sweat and tears mingling with the blood on his face, but he managed to look at Gelbstein. He shook his head, a tiny, desperate motion. *Don't.*\n\nThe silence stretched, broken only by Nuka's ragged breaths. Peterson finally sighed, a sound of genuine disappointment. \"You Falkos men. So predictably stubborn.\" He pulled his sidearm from its holster. \"You're both compromised. You're no use to me alive if you won't talk.\" He walked over, not to Nuka, but to Gelbstein. He pressed the cold muzzle of the pistol against Gelbstein's chest, right over his heart.\n\"This is your last chance, Captain.\"\n\nGelbstein just stared into his eyes, filled with a hate so pure it was almost serene. \"Suck my dick.\"\n*BANG.*\nThe world exploded in a flash of white-hot pain. A force like a sledgehammer slammed into his chest, stealing his breath. Gelbstein’s head snapped back, his body slumping forward against the restraints. His vision swam, the edges turning dark. Through the ringing in his ears, he heard Nuka screaming his name, a sound of pure terror and desperation.\n\nHis gaze found Nuka one last time. The man's face was a mask of horror. As Gelbstein’s life bled out onto the concrete floor, he saw Nuka’s foot slam back against the leg of his own chair. A sharp, distinct *tap*.\nWhat the fuck was he doing—\nDarkness swallowed everything.","A dull ache hammered against the inside of his skull. Consciousness returned like a slow, painful tide, dragging him from a black, dreamless void. His wrists and ankles were raw, chafed against what felt like heavy metal locks securing him to a chair. A cold bastard of a chair. A single, bare lightbulb swung from a cord overhead, casting long, dancing shadows across the damp concrete floor. The only sounds were the rhythmic *creak* of the chain and the drip, drip, drip of water somewhere in the darkness.\n\nHe blinked the grit from his eyes, his gaze immediately snapping to the other figure in the room. Nuka. Slumped in a chair identical to his own, head lolling forward. Still breathing, thank fuck for small mercies. The kid looked roughed up, a fresh cut bleeding sluggishly on his cheek, but he was alive. For now. Gelbstein tested his bonds, pulling hard. The metal didn't give, it only bit deeper into his flesh. Fucking solid.\n\nA heavy metal door scraped open, flooding the room with brighter light for a moment before slamming shut with a deafening *THUD*. A silhouette stood there, resolving into a familiar, treacherous face as it stepped into the dim light. Peterson. Fucking Worm. The piece of shit had the gall to smile, a lazy, confident expression that made Gelbstein want to rip his throat out with his teeth. He wasn’t alone; two larger men flanked him, their faces impassive and cruel.\n\n“Captain. Private. Glad you could finally join us.” Peterson's voice was calm, conversational. It made Gelbstein's blood run cold with a quiet, simmering rage. He pulled up a spare metal stool, the legs scraping loudly against the concrete, and sat down backwards, arms resting on its backrest. \"Now, this can be quick and relatively painless, or it can be a very, very long night. The choice is yours.\"\n\nHe saw Nuka stir, lifting his head. A glare of pure, undiluted hatred was aimed at the traitor. \"Eat shit,\" Nuka spat, his voice hoarse but firm.\n\nPeterson simply chuckled, a dry and humorless sound. “Spirit. I always admired that. But it won't do you any good here.” He leaned forward slightly. “I’ll make this simple. Falkos mission logs. Specifically, the Kantar and West Platinn coordinates for the next two months. Give them to me.”\n\nGelbstein stared him down, letting the silence stretch. He gave nothing away, his face a mask of stone. Every instinct screamed at him, every fiber of his being was coiled tight, ready for a violence he couldn't unleash. “Go fuck yourself, Peterson,” the words were a low growl, thick with his Saneran accent.\n\nPeterson sighed, a theatrical display of disappointment. “I was afraid you’d say that. I really was.” He nodded to the two brutes standing by the door. “Start with the little one. Let’s see how much the Captain enjoys the show.” One of the men moved with brutal efficiency, grabbing Nuka by the hair and yanking his head back. The other drew back a fist. The sound of knuckles hitting flesh was a wet, ugly *SMACK*.\n\nNuka cried out, a sharp, strangled noise that cut right through Gelbstein’s composure. Instinct took over. He strained against the locks, muscles screaming in protest, the metal digging into his skin until it bled. Fucking useless. He could only watch as another blow landed, this time to the gut. Nuka gasped, doubling over as much as the restraints would allow.\n\n“Give me the coordinates, Captain,” Peterson’s voice was dangerously soft, cutting through the haze of fury. “Or we start breaking things. Fingers, maybe? Let's dislocate his shoulder first, shall we? I’m open to suggestions.” He gestured, and one of the men grabbed Nuka’s arm, forcing it back at an unnatural angle. A gut-wrenching scream tore from Nuka's throat as a sickening *POP* echoed in the small room.\n\nGelbstein’s own breath hitched. He shut his eyes for a second, the sound burning itself into his brain. He opened them again, his gaze locking with Peterson’s, promising a violent, painful death. “You will get… nothing.”","A groan rumbled deep in his chest as consciousness clawed its way back. The world swam into focus with a nauseating sway, timed to the creak of a single, naked bulb swinging overhead. The light cast long, dancing shadows across a damp concrete floor. His head throbbed, a dull, hammering pain behind the eyes. A metallic taste, coppery and foul, coated his tongue. Blood. His blood. He was seated, he realized. Secured to a cold, hard chair. Metal cuffs dug into his wrists and ankles, tight enough to cut off circulation. Fucking perfect.\n\nHe tested the restraints, pulling against them with the full force of his shoulders. The chair didn't budge, bolted to the floor. The metal only bit deeper into his flesh. Shit. He scanned the room, his eyes adjusting to the gloom. And then he saw him. Nuka. Slumped in a chair identical to his own, just a few meters away. The younger man was still out, his head lolled to one side. Fuck. This was bad. This was very, very bad. His own fuck-up. He was the Captain, he was responsible. Now his man was in enemy hands because of him. The thought was a hot spike of acid in his gut.\n\nFootsteps echoed from a dark hallway, growing louder. Two men emerged into the light. One was a tall, nondescript brute. The other, the one who looked to be in charge, had a face that was just begging to be rearranged by a good punch. This must be Peterson. \"Well, look what we have here. The big Captain Gelbstein of Falkos's esteemed Alpha Team. And a little birdy.\" His voice was calm, almost conversational, which made it all the more infuriating. \"I have questions. You have answers. Provide them, and this ordeal can be over with minimal fuss.\"\n\nGino spat a clot of blood and saliva onto the floor. \"Go fuck yourself.\"\n\nPeterson’s smile didn’t waver. It was a cold, dead thing. \"That's one way to go about it.\" He gestured to the brute, who immediately moved towards Nuka. \"But I find it's always better to start with the subordinate. They're usually so eager to stop the pain.\" The brute grabbed a fistful of Nuka's hair, yanking his head back with a sickening snap. Nuka came to with a choked gasp, eyes flying wide with panic and pain.\n\nA primal roar of fury tore from Gino's throat. He surged against his bonds, the steel grinding against his bones. The chair creaked under the strain but held fast. \"Don't you fucking touch him, you hear me?! You want something, you deal with me, you cowardly piece of shit!\"\n\nPeterson completely ignored him, his focus entirely on Nuka. \"The coordinates for your last three missions. And the next one. Simple.\" The brute produced a pair of pliers, the metal glinting under the dim light. He grabbed Nuka's left hand, pinning it to the armrest of the chair. Nuka struggled, his breath coming in ragged, terrified pants. A high-pitched, desperate whine tore from his throat.\n\n\"I will kill you,\" Gino seethed, his voice dropping to a low, guttural promise. \"I will fucking find you and I will tear your throat out with my teeth.\"\n\n*CRACK.*\n\nThe sound was sharp, sickeningly loud in the small room. It was followed by a raw, agonized scream from Nuka that clawed at Gino's insides. The brute had broken one of his fingers. He was holding up the pliers again, ready for the next one. Nuka was sobbing now, a mess of tears and snot, but no words came out. Not a single coordinate. Not a single piece of intel. Just pure, unadulterated pain.\n\n\"Fucking stop it!\" Gino bellowed, his voice hoarse with rage. He thrashed violently, putting every ounce of his strength into breaking free, into getting to them. \"He doesn't know anything! He's just a private, you fucking cunts! You want intel, you come to me!\" It was a lie, Nuka knew plenty, but it was all he had. Peterson watched Gino's futile struggle with detached amusement before nodding to the brute. Another finger. *SNAP.* Another scream tore through the air, this one weaker, choked with agony."],"swipe_info":[{"send_date":"June 6, 2025 12:55am","gen_started":"2025-06-05T16:54:48.839Z","gen_finished":"2025-06-05T16:55:08.917Z","extra":{"api":"openrouter","model":"google/gemini-2.5-pro-preview","reasoning":"**Assessing the Situation**\n\nI'm currently dissecting the user's prompt, mapping out the essential components.

I'm considering the brutal interrogation tactics, focusing on creating a realistic portrayal of torture and the emotional impact on both Gelbstein and Nuka. I'm also thinking about the activation of the time loop device, planning how each character can trigger it after being fatally wounded.\n\n\n**Planning the Execution**\n\nI've mapped out the loop activation conditions meticulously. The boots, the wounds, the blood registry—it's all coming together to create a tight, suspenseful trigger.

Then, Peterson enters.\n\n\n**Outlining the Narrative**\n\nI'm now streamlining the narrative arc. I've finalized the core events: betrayal, interrogation, escalating torture, and the fatal wound.

The G1 Warehouse in the Kantar district seems important, and I'm trying to understand the relationships between Gelbstein (that's me, Avi), Nuka (the user), Peterson (\"Worm\"), and the two Bhiya thugs. I'm mapping out their roles to see what comes next.\n\n\n**Considering the Stakes**\n\nI've got a solid grasp on the characters and setting, and the overall plot. The torture aspect is where it gets tricky; finding the right balance between graphic detail and narrative flow is key, while also keeping Nuka's role in mind. Time loops add another layer. I'm contemplating how best to convey the tension of the situation, and what actions I will be taking.\n\n\n**Evaluating the Options**\n\nI've narrowed down the choices for my opening response. Rage is the primary motivator. I'll focus on Gelbstein's internal struggle to protect Nuka, utilizing harsh language and sensory details, making the torture visceral. I'll consider ways to redirect Peterson's attention. Dialogue will be crucial. I'm ready to begin.\n\n\n**Devising a Strategy**\n\nI've broken down the scene into digestible segments. My primary focus is now on Phase 1 and 2: Gelbstein's rage and Peterson's predictable, escalating response to Nuka's defiance. I'm considering how to inject some dark humor and misdirection into Gelbstein's dialogue to disrupt Peterson's focus and buy Nuka time, all while focusing on visceral sensory details to immerse Nuka (the user).\n\n\n**Crafting the Initial Response**\n\nNow, I'm focusing on writing the first few paragraphs. I'll start with Gelbstein's immediate reaction: the cessation of the electricity, Nuka's labored breaths, and the burning scent. I'll use sharp, visceral language reflecting his raw, unrestrained rage and helplessness, followed by Peterson's calculated, cold response to set the stage for escalation. Dialogue will be terse.\n\n\n**Refining the Narrative**\n\nI'm now focused on the details of the torture, particularly the progression and Peterson's responses. I'm aiming for visceral descriptions of Nuka's pain, and Gelbstein's futile attempts to intervene and redirect the violence. I'm working on Peterson's lines to maintain a sense of cold calculation. I'm also trying to weave in elements of Gelbstein's internal monologue, showing his mounting desperation.\n\n\n**Composing the Initial Draft**\n\nI've now structured the scene's progression and written the individual paragraphs. I've focused on Gelbstein's immediate fury, Peterson's calculated response, and the escalation of torture. I'm confident that the visceral elements are present and effective, and the dialogue works. I'll be reviewing the draft to ensure the tone remains consistent with the character and setting.\n\n\n**Structuring the Violence**\n\nI'm now working on arranging the stages of Peterson's brutality. It involves the initial physical assault, focusing on visceral impacts, then escalating to the use of a tool. I'm also planning to interweave Gelbstein's futile attempts to distract and absorb the punishment. Emphasis on sensory details remains key to the narrative's impact.","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":1321}}]}

Next, I'll consider the likely objectives and how those players will likely behave.\n\n\n**Outlining the Stakes**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the specifics of the scenario.

The scene is being written around this desperate tension, with the car battery or waterboarding forming the next escalation of the torture.\n\n\n**Crafting Gelbstein's Defense**\n\nI'm refining Gelbstein's response. He needs to both protect Nuka and seek an escape route. I'm currently working on Gelbstein's attempts to provoke Peterson.

They were going to fucking drown him in inches of water while he was still conscious.\n\n\"Enough!\" The word exploded from Gelbstein, raw and desperate. He fought against the pure, primal need to kill, his training screaming at him to find a way out, any fucking way. \"You want intel? You want coordinates? Fine. Fucking fine.\" His voice was hoarse, strained. Each word felt like swallowing glass. \"Let him go. Uncuff him. Let him sit in a corner, and I'll tell you whatever the fuck you want to know. My word.\"\n\nHe hated himself for it. He hated the weakness. But the sight of Nuka's mangled hand, the memory of that choked gurgle as water filled his lungs—it was breaking something inside him. Something he thought was unbreakable.\n\nPeterson just smiled, a slow, ugly curving of the lips. It was the smile of a predator that knew it had won. \"See? I knew you had it in you, Captain. But let's not be hasty.\" He crouched down in front of Gelbstein, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. \"Let's make sure you're telling the truth. We'll start with the rally point. And for every coordinate you give me... he keeps a finger. That seems fair, doesn't it?\"","title":"","swipe_id":1,"swipes":["<cont>\n*CRUNCH.*\n\nThe sound ripped through Gelbstein’s skull, a sickening mixture of splintering bone and pulped flesh. A raw, animal noise was torn from Nuka’s throat as he convulsed, the agony overwhelming him. Gelbstein’s world narrowed to that sound, to the sight of Nuka’s foot, now a bloody ruin. The metallic scent of blood grew stronger, sharp and coppery in the damp air.\n\n*I am going to tear him apart.* The thought was no longer rage. It was a cold, hard promise, a point of absolute certainty in a universe that had gone fucking insane. This wasn't about the mission. It wasn't about Falkos or traitors or intel. This was about Peterson, and the bill that was coming due.\n\nHe pulled at the cuffs, grinding them into his wrists. The pain was distant, a dull echo against the roaring inferno in his gut. Blood seeped from the lacerations, slick and warm. He needed to get loose. He needed to put his hands around Peterson’s throat and squeeze until something gave.\n\n\"This is getting tedious, Captain,\" Peterson sighed, stepping around the blood drops as if they were a fucking nuisance. \"But I have all night. I wonder how many toes he has left?\"\n\nThe thug adjusted his grip, the bloody pliers hovering over the next toe. Gelbstein watched, his breath catching in his throat. He saw Nuka’s head loll, his body limp and trembling with shock. He couldn't take much more of this. No one could.\n\n\"Peterson,\" Gelbstein’s voice was low, a dangerous, gravelly thing. \"You're a fucking dead man.\"\n\n\"Threats are cheap.\" He gestured with a flick of his wrist. \"Let's take another one. Maybe that will loosen his—or your—tongue.\"\n\nBut as the thug moved to obey, the single lightbulb above them flickered once, twice, and then went out with a soft *POP*. The room plunged into absolute, pitch-black darkness. A heartbeat of dead silence followed, broken only by Nuka's wet, ragged breathing.\n\nThen, chaos erupted.\n\nThe sharp, unsynchronized *CRACK* of two gunshots from different corners of the room shattered the quiet. The screams that followed were cut short. A heavy *THUD* hit the concrete near Gelbstein, then another. A strangled grunt, a wet gurgle. Someone was being killed in the dark.\n\n_Who the fuck—?_\n\nA high-pitched electronic whine pierced the air, growing rapidly in volume. The steel door to the room slammed shut with a deafening *CLANG* that vibrated through the floor. A series of heavy, percussive *THUNKS* followed as deadbolts were thrown from the outside, sealing them in.\n\n\"What the fuck is happening?\" Peterson’s voice, for the first time, was tight with alarm. \"Lights! Get the fucking lights!\"\n\nA moment later, a powerful flashlight beam cut through the darkness, frantically sweeping across the room. It illuminated the two Bhiya thugs, both dead on the floor in spreading pools of their own blood. One had a bullet hole clean through his forehead. The other's throat was a gaping, bloody mess.\n\nThe beam jerked around, finally settling on the corner near the door. The light reflected off something—a small, dark object no bigger than a man's palm. It was wedged into the door's control panel, emitting a faint, pulsating red light.\n\nPeterson stared at it, his face pale in the reflected beam. \"A scrambler... Who the fuck is out there?\"\n\nHe swung the flashlight back towards Gelbstein and Nuka, his momentary panic hardening back into cold fury. \"This is your doing, isn't it? You had a fucking backup plan!\"\n\nHe stalked towards Nuka's chair, the beam of light dancing wildly. \"Talk! Who is out there? What did you do?!\" He punctuated the last word with a vicious kick to Nuka’s injured leg.","\"Peterson!\"\n\nThe name was a fucking guttural roar, torn from the deepest parts of him. He yanked at his restraints, the steel cutting into his skin, feeling the warm slick of his own blood running down his arms. The pain was a distant signal, drowned out by the absolute, all-consuming furnace of rage inside his chest. He saw the pliers, saw the mangled mess of Nuka’s foot, heard that choked, inhuman sound of agony. A red film descended over his vision.\n\nHe could only watch. Fucking watch. The most useless a man could ever be. He was a captain, sworn to protect his men, and he was strapped to a goddamn chair while his best soldier was taken apart piece by piece. The metallic taste of blood filled his mouth, though he hadn't bitten his tongue. It was the phantom taste of failure.\n\n_I will fucking tear you limb from limb. I will rip out your throat with my teeth. I will make you beg for a death you will never fucking get._ The thoughts were a silent, vicious prayer inside his skull. The promise was no longer just a threat; it was a fucking prophecy.\n\nHe watched Peterson's sick, smug face, cataloging every detail for the future. The way his eyes crinkled when he smiled at another man's suffering. The slight twitch in his jaw. Gelbstein was engraving a death warrant onto his own soul. He didn't care about intel anymore. He didn't care about Falkos. He only cared about the violence he was going to visit upon this fucking traitor.\n\n\"Still not talking?\" Peterson clucked his tongue, a mockery of disappointment. \"He's a tough one. I'll give him that.\" He gestured again at the thug. \"Maybe he needs to cool off.\"\n\nThe thug with the canteen moved back toward Nuka's head. The wet rag, now stained with a bit of blood from Nuka's coughing, was still in his hand. They were going to do it again. They were going to fucking drown him in inches of water while he was still conscious.\n\n\"Enough!\" The word exploded from Gelbstein, raw and desperate.

His gaze locked onto the faint red line blooming on Nuka’s neck, a stark contrast to the pale, sweat-slicked skin. A low, guttural growl rumbled deep in his chest, a sound of pure, unadulterated murder. The world narrowed to that grinning cunt, Peterson, and the feel of cold steel biting into his own flesh. The helplessness was a physical fucking weight, pressing down on him, suffocating him. He pulled against the restraints, feeling the sharp, grinding pain in his wrists as skin tore and metal scraped against bone. He welcomed it. The pain was real. The pain was his.\n\nHe watched Nuka shake his head, the small, defiant gesture sending a fresh wave of sick, twisted pride through him.

In his hand was a pair of dirty, rust-stained pliers. Not the heavy-duty ones from before. These were smaller, needle-nosed, designed for precision. The thug reached out and, with a brutal lack of ceremony, grabbed Nuka’s lower lip, yanking it down to expose his bottom teeth.\n\n*Fuck. No. Not this.

Gelbstein wouldn't be eloquent, he'd be blunt and to the point. He sees a problem, he addresses it, and that's it. It has to be more than just suspicion. It has to be that gut feeling, that sense of unease, that this recruit isn't a \"normal\" soldier, that this kid is trouble. \n\nThe task at hand is to build the tension between these two characters, even if it's based on Gelbstein's instinct. It has to be something that resonates, that *clicks* - a subtle dance of attention, like the story's initial encounter.","reasoning_duration":null,"token_count":878}}]}
